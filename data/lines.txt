we were waiting for the
never gonna get enough of your kisses
if you got an itch to scratch
a little bit of this, a little bit of that
gave your hand to me
just another world that i
you you you make me feel everything more
stone cold crazy stoned
and i feel it heating up, working up a sweat
i'm ready to take the devil down
give me the go round
coffee two creams room to breathe
don't know what to do with myself with my love
for what's left of my soul
never knew i had so much to lose
holding out for a stroke of luck
and the days and weeks have passed
on our way through
in love with a run-away dream
but the devil didn't come through
i don't want to know oh oh oh oh
to make it alright
i'm just trying to get off the ground
you're the wild one
for the rest of our lives
i've been riding on the breeze
so far horizons fade
it was in me, made it mine
building a life on love
of the man that i used to be
i know they say that it never goes away
it's a long way to the top
been to the rally but i couldn't stand
the last of the blues
i got reasons to live
to live to see a better day
i just wanna be gone gone gone
rage in my veins
will get you half-way to crazy town
but it was only words thrown to the wind now
she's got the stars in her eyes
feeling as this one
my conscience stabbed with pain
but i can't stop now
you lift the clouds, you clear the fog
and you'd been trying to get through
when it comes around
it's my chance to do something for the world
giving you the reins
made myself a beeline for the old town
we've got nothing but heaven tonight
i wanna hear ya
your heart ain't in it
and i'm seeing stars again
looking round the room
for that stranger again
but everything real comes back somehow
gimme just a shot (uh oh)
the shining hope of my world again
you climbed the mountains while i ran the rat race
all this time i've been passing through
and when i'm low there's nowhere but up
she's a double whammy
got plans for today
we're making some kind of magic tonight
come and get it
time will, move in, circles
it can make the angels sing
but tell me who'll wear your boots
you're my two of these
the sun is coming back again
you make make me feel everything more
i'm gonna give it back
right here back in the valley again
til i forgot about it
i'm selling all my stock
tell me what ya want
'cause it kills me too
and when she smiles at me basking in the glory
fits and starts and storyboards
and my house of cards is tumbling down
handed his dreams to the working week
highway's shining in her headlights
dancing in the rain
i've been holding up my horses
and try to find a better way
if it's 50 50 or it's 90 10
when it gets ya
gimme just a fat chance
seen you in a minute (been a minute)
and it's too hard to ignore
i didn't know what got into you
we might as well have settled for half full
get it while it's good
from one end to the other she had me hooked
one day we'll make it alright
it can make the world go round
you're gonna get there, or you know you're not
i love the love but i can't take the shit
i learned to like the sleepless nights
and i know a room from the view
so babe would you give me two more chances
i'm comin' on the down low
just a little bit better on my own
baby that could be us
well it's tit for tat
stupid people are trying to hold me back
we're making love bit by bit (going digital)
went back home but there was no one there
as i put it in a vase
end of the line
i could fall in love with your face
makes me see the possibility of who i could be
i know i said it first
i thought i told ya for the millionth time
yeah we know we're both gonna lose
handed us the keys
and if you save it for a rainy day
and a hand in the cookie jar
'cause you can dodge the rain drops
til the darkness caught up with me
riding on a bad wave
if you wanna go
i want the day to come
'til i'm back at the end of the road
we'll be knockin' 'em back
it's just another two-bit saturday night
left home so long ago
i'll be the shoulder you lean on
why can't i find a way back
been a minute in the fog
and have her spend the night
looking for your real friends
we learned to like the sleepless nights
right where i began
i got a note
everything you have is right here waiting
so i ran down the dream
to kick the devil out
tipping all the waiters
with the change of the season
who'll roll in the hay
then turn on the light
so baby don't ya fade on me tonight
you won't get far with that attitude
i ain't looking for a promise
bucks (and a case of the blues)
everything except your smile
to make one night
i'm waiting on you one day at a time
the memories are bitter, they're left inside of me
take me back to the wishing well
is there love out there to find
and they of perpetual rewind
make the world go away
and we'll be back for more
to my hands 'til i let it go
they were based on real things, but they aren't real
then you're gettin' back for more
another lover singing in your choir
crazy eyes, poker face
drifts a little farther from the shore
i'm gonna get out while i still got time
the way you move
wash away these lost years
i'm six feet underground
roll into the city in a 97 jetta
i ain't doing your rain dance
and i tried to tune it out
tried to stop the war
to make it through the day
i'm asking for the millionth time
with only half a prayer
down to the bone
there's no reason to get comfortable
we're gonna be alright
you and me are headed for the same palm tree
hanging on the edge
'cause i ain't ready to go
who'll yodelay your cowgirl song
we been longing so long
it ain't easy when the cards don't fall your way
she said we've already crossed that line
oh oh, fade it in again
one line to draw
what you say but you can't see
like a train in the night
all the tunnels have shut off their light
holding on to hope in vain
this world is wearing me down
but now i'm here for you
i can do the happy dance with two left feet
i got no worries left for you
you live it better on the other half
flying through the red lights holding down the pedal
we stood apart on an island each praying
takes a whole lot, whole lotta love
and she'll never even know
but no angels came upon me
far as i can tell
to hell and back on a round trip plane
but that only works on the sincere and the pure
a pot of gold on a rainbow ramp
i won't bring roses 'cause baby i know this
been in the sauna but i couldn't breathe
i'm just looking up at the view babe
i'm better off without you (uh huh)
sick of the hopeless 'cause baby i know this
where we could always look
let's find our side of paradise
and i'm trying every way
i could move the mountains but it won't mean much
oh oh i lost my mind
waiting on a line for the line
i'm broken in pieces
soon as i find my way
and fall like two drops of rain
gonna put it on a fast train (alright)
when the stars fall down from the sky
what's on the other side of the hole
i can't follow you into the deep
to be this way
(stuck) in a rut
take a message get back to em later, just
it's pulling out of the station
send me a sign
she got me with those puppy dog eyes
and i don't know if you feed me lines
that i'm better off without you (uh huh)
gotta little fire left in me
but there's nothing there 'cept your own imagination
make a place to belong
i'm gonna feel this for the rest of my life
if you can't dance with who brought
and get back on it, make that jump
and we were chasing empty ghosts
like it did that day?
and i tried to make it stop
'cause sometimes it takes a lot
lightning on my feet
tear up the town
living through the end of times
give me a world where i belong
i'm better off without ya
and i wish you would send me a sign
i've been the fish and i've been the hook
i've been getting lost in you
so next time here's the deal
to hell and back and back again
we can make it last forever tonight
and i tried to keep the faith
i bought a rose for someone
wake me into your arms
a million times more won't add up to much
'cause i just can't wait
now real life is an afterthought
to cut you down to size
makes the baby jesus cry
love won't tear us apart
but that don't change the weather
a pretty cover and a real good book
who'll wear your boots
i can't be somebody i can't be
i don't know when i got to go
no one put roses in my garden
someone to boldly go
gonna drown in it
every storybook was not for me
end of the road
and they came down
just to get through to you
every way you make me feel
sky is clear tonight
but i'm ready to take nothing
we were waiting to a-
i ain't waiting for a better day
been sinking so fast i'm already underground
and counting the stars in my eyes
i want more (oh oh oh)
who do i have to know
'cause i threw the rockwell out the window
'cause how'd you know it was just in time
fallen and i can't get up
the way i need her still
you gotta burn it down
born with a broken heart
for the orchestra to start
we're starting fires in a world of ice
this is how they got me
'cause it's time to set fire to your little world
if you're going somewhere i'm going there too
and make the same things new
trying to keep my cool
but that only proves
'cause it's better late than never, if never never comes
fishing for a line
feeling as this love
it's a long way down down down
just a little peace of mind
i'll be the second coming of james dean
tall dark handsome and rich
you're the one who takes
you can't make a monk with only half a prayer
so i'm headed down
counting time to the beat of my heart
turning me inside out
'til the only way left to go was right
hurry up, put down those love letters
and start over and over again
i'm falling down and you've been falling away
'cause i got one hand on the trigger
sun shinin' through where they said it'd get better
wash away my sad face
then be my marilyn monroe
but i've been down this road once or twice
let the time fly by
kid tested mother approved
to break my lonely fall
trying to work in a line
never gonna fall in love
now i can see past my own lies
you might win the battle
so fast since we've been apart
and every day was only hope
i've been livin' on the low-down
happy days are somewhere inside this life
marching me to the beat of her second-line
'cause you can keep on yappin
sometimes it's a long way down
you're my sugar pill
it could be the glory of your dreams
queen of the underground
it'll get ya just a little turned around
but i'm still alive
but someday, when you throw my ashes to the sea
i've got a feeling it all comes down
if you won't give it back
on that stranger to come round again
'cause everyone's a stranger to me now
but we swam back
so i'll jump on into the ocean
and wondering where this road ends
it's just a matter of the birds and the bees
i want more than i'll ever have
tryin to find that old feeling
just for a moment in a world full of strangers
you shoulda come with a warning sign
ace in the hole
i saw a heart just trying to say it
move it slowly to me
if we go down in flames
wake me into a new world
as your house burns down
someone to open the door
they'll hold it all against me
in those hills of grass
to open up your heart
to the world that's right front of us
so today i'm gonna jump into a brand new ocean
and the light's shining through
and when the next life begins
when the rooster crows
let's call it a plan
i let it take me (i gave it all)
sounds good to me
put on your dreamer's hat
something i thought i'd find by now
i don't know what happened to you
and you're praying at the bar
can't leave the stable without burning some hay hay hay
i'm just waiting for the nick of time
'cause she's too cool for me
i got a bone pick
now we're the downcast on our way up
i feel the fire inside of me
gonna hit the fast lane
you fell out of the love tree (uh huh)
sign on the dotted line
i'm gonna take the devil down
to save a broken heart
is never too far from the light
i'm just looking for a sign
can't play, can't fold
right in this moment
trains are all gone and the horses
i'll get what she got
getting back on track
it's nothing to them
your static's ringing in my ears
but i'm coming to my senses now
someday may it find me
you can bet on it
before the feeling's through
just push the pedal down lower
how far that i can get
wasting it all away
but now i take it back
waiting for a golden key
that's where the trains don't go oh oh
tell me who'll fill the pantry when you leave
i will be here long after you're gone
'cause when i'm high i'm good as it comes
you make me feel everything
just a wake up call
in how many worlds must i
until i make you mine
the way that you kiss me
find a way to her
i fanned your fire
i got big plans
two hearts in perpetual motion
like it was meant to be
but that road leads to nowhere in the end
bending these moments to my will
how come nothing's ever easy? (ooh ooh ooh)
until the sun shines harder
you gotta whole lotta me
living life this way
i'm better off without you
where do i sign
back on the town
i was okay keeping up with today
here to bring a good man down
so i wear my fire like a tattoo
'cause there's never gonna be a feeling like this one
humming an old melody
can anybody help me
and find the spirit
don't wanna turn the love light on
when it comes you gotta run the other way
i waiting around for you to come my way
we got nothing but time
but they stole that plan
it's taking me over
i wanna know that this is real
surrender to the air
took my heart away
slippin' backwards and i'm falling away
hail mary & hallelujah
now i'm just a body waiting for a soul
someday, when i'm riding on the wind
ain't gonna be no sideshow
we don't ask the sun to shine
been to the choir but i couldn't sing
and together we made our way through the wilderness
those days will never come back
we got the world on a string
and we'd drink a toast for the foolish old ghost
place at the table
to an empty room
that didn't take so long
now i want tomorrow
so pour me a drink
let's make a love song
i should have asked for more
you gotta come out from the shadows
she walks the talk and does the deeds
when i got clouds to chase away
you shouldn't be seen with freaks like me
ya gotta get into the right swing
i'm gonna sit in my room
think on it (just a little bit more)
to prove my love to you
we came a long way into the light
we're taking it back
i ain't waiting (nah nah)
burning down 'til my hands let it go
every little thing you do
i'm always wondering if i should have asked for more
and ours got lost
and when i'm down i'm under the ground
'cause i'm lovestruck again
one soul lost is one more crashing to the ground
well it's time to feel it
tore up from the floor up
sometimes i can't seem to move
gonna find the devil hiding in so many places
to keep me in line
right out of our hands
storm is coming you're down on your luck
you made it to the door
my feet were stuck in the mud
i'll be taking out the phone to call ya
if ya wanna do it too
it was all the same without ya
my temperature is rising
you were just a tick in the clock of time
let the good times roll
here comes another one
you gotta throw me a line
get lost in the groove
i've been a prisoner of your love
everyone i turned to turned away
time to burn some bridges down
and it's time to take the devil down
and here i am dazed and confused
you brought me down
when it all comes together
'cause the sun is rising in my world
to take the scenic route
'cause ya know there ain't no one round
fool for a fool
you only gave it everything
right back where i started from
it won't last for long
another chance at fame
big time (uh oh oh)
if they'd remember me
but we could never touch
trying to find a way to her heart
all the way to other side
what if we never make the sun shine
until the moon falls out of the sky
you make me feel everything more
but don't put away your broken heart
and ya know there ain't nowhere else
go and do what you're meant to
taking it day by day
barking up the wrong tree
my cool but it seems out of place
but she disappeared too soon
and we can keep the life they stole
jumped out the fire escape
and anywhere this crazy life goes
before i even said it to you
babe i'm coming home quick
ten years was a long goodbye
and you're hooked on the groove
it's how we do it in sf
i'm gonna drive off your cliff in a flaming car
the rug was pulled from under me
it just ain't the same without ya
straight to hell in a handbasket
before they've even passed
but the world didn't stop turning for my pride
wanna be pop but i'm not
whispers don't make a sound
well they can paint their lines
took the last train
take a message get back to em later
then say you never meant it
i'm in no hurry
holding back the love
just for calling it quits
but i don't care bout the price to pay
tears in the tide
always part of me
ya hit me in the sweetest spot
'cause there ain't nothing else to do around here
it don't matter baby
but she isn't looking for me
for a good time call someone else
on a saturday night out
'cause no one really cares where you came from
queen of the underworld
i got a feeling
prayer for the gods and a slap in the face
if you're headed up to the sky
headed down to fog town
down to the ashes
you had a message for me
just two happy soldiers of the light of love
til i started singing your praises
and you don't gotta to waste your time
can't sit still, run away
i'd just be waiting
taking, laid back one, make it, getter done
and painted their leaves
they're gonna give it anyway
i've been waiting for the day that i'll forget
maybe it was an angel
someone wake us up when the end has come
too bad for nothing
i'm taking the long road
make me a joyful sound
if we're not strong enough
and i like them all
love is not here forever
she's got the will and she's got the means
uh oh when she gets that feeling
papers scattered on the floor
find a way back
gonna hop a rocket and fly away (hey hey)
so don't put away your broken heart
this old hat down
but now i'm headed back to see
waiting to be free one day
lose myself so i can find
with a fighting streak
you're taking me over
i'll be your soldier i'll be your song
you'll make the sun shine harder
i couldn't make yesterday last
she's got the sails up high
two hands up into the sky
it's been so long
when the only time is now
why pray to angels and shake magic eight balls
born between the lines
who'll cook the beans and pop the corn
but she can take me anywhere
'cause they're knocking on my door
a whole lotta life (so watcha waiting for)
see a man about a dog
if you wanna walk
throw it on out
i've seen the love in your eyes
anything to calm my mind
it was one more night that we made it through
flinching, razor's edge, on edge
when every time that you smile
you make me see the light shine through the fog
i'm waiting for the say so
when i don't care bout you no more
but i want to hold her like a kitten
and maybe we could be
turning me upside down
and i watched from the comfort of my misery
let me get that straight
that flew on down that day
you never were a quitter twiddling your thumbs
pply more makeup 'cause the
with my head in the clouds
we're all headed for the same palm tree
like i'm 8-years old again
i bet ya think your anger is important
you make me feel uh huh everything everything more
and get back on it
love her like a sister
looking for the light, it's been looking for you back
making my way back to you
'cause it's one foot in the fire
i'm tired of waiting on this love train
now you're gone, and i am fine
everyone is slipping into comfortable these days
let it rise, take the light, let it fall
to a kingdom of the blind
to care about you 'cause i got no worries
tapped in (tapped on in)
if you're headed down
take me for a fool
if your heart ain't in it
i'll meet you where the trains don't go (oh oh)
making all our own luck
everyone is making time
calling out through my stomach walls
i jumped through flames
when love comes around
sitting on the highest cloud
talked to the angels but they said nothing
down to bare bones
all i'm asking of you
we could call it our own
something in your heart
and i've been falling down
put away my broken heart
'cause there's lovin' left to do
better off on my own
they can just sit back and watch
i don't need those pixie dust dreams
and it hit me in the face
when you look at me
let's make a world of our own
get back on the horse
the beggars, the players, the smooth operators
like chance on the wind
watching my house of cards fall
living through the dark days
that we can move
don't look at me like that
oh baby go on make me yours
and i tried the spiritual and the miracle cure
gonna find my way to you
i'll figure it out
and what did it get you anyhow?
now i'm so happy (uh huh)
i want to be the star shining for your star
for the sunday morning all stars
lettin' my feet hang down babe and
the way that i know how to do
alone and alive i said
talking to an empty room
she's got the devil by her side
your eyes say all i need to hear
you can do better than that
falling down from cloud nine
waiting for the candle to burn out
strapped to a rolling stone
got a long way to go tonight
and just make you better for it
i got my head in the clouds
(woh oh oh oh oh) down the drain
if we go up in smoke
all these worlds i've been passing through
and when you arrive don't remember these times
but it's leaving me behind
it was the only way
won't you pull a piece of heaven down for me
and i want to remember the look in your eye
pour my troubles down the drain
heart of the problem
next to me tonight
ain't nothin wrong with ya
she's still medium rare
calling through my stomach walls
breathing in and out and in
and we can talk about the old times
breathe in the truth
like a flash of rain
we drank em under the table
it all looks good to me
when you're spinnin your wheels
but it's starting to feel like
some day some day some day
i'm down in the valley losing my mind again
from the water bring new birth
hard case of love
rolling down the track
and finally i'm fading out of blue
it is what it is
no one ever had their say
time's been ticking away
been to the club but i couldn't join
to be the happy after ever after
and we were always jumping on the big waves
i got things to do
howl on the dirty moon
bit in a hifi world
so much for up and on
middle of nowhere was all i could find
'cause it's never gonna be the same
right in front of me
i've been hiding out in midtown
that's how it feels
and a lifetime of the pain that came before
but it's not their turn
you were the candle with the flame burning down
on to these old dreams
with their atom bombs
she sailed on waves
i tried to reach her
tonight we'll dive off the deep end
all to play a losing game
trying to catch up
it's all the same without ya
i'm still trying to find
mama you can get high
time to saddle up the horse
while i was learning breathe
looking everywhere for mrs make-it-alright
blah blah blah
than you bargained for
but this feeling came from the blue
(real for ya) i'll make it real for ya
gonna take a walk to easy street
with those eyes that you make
putting that life six feet underground
so many walls we could have knocked down
letting it all play out babe
one place or another now
i said it's not over til it's over
our little light shining afar
living in the strangest kinda times
so if the poetry ain't rolling off my tongue
safe inside our own four walls
and i'm dreaming of the day
just one more thing to hold on to
tear all your fences down
when self control jumped out the window
i don't need it anymore
and packing up the company
you make make me feel everything everything more
up to my ankles in it
i'm ready if you're willing
slice o' the pie
when it's time to move
til you're cutting round those corners
making storybooks come true
i'm getting high as i wanna tonight
give me that look
strip malls and heartaches
yeah, let me get this straight
the kinda love from just one look
one day closer to the grave
with her angels and her devils
down in the valley up on the hill
i got a lock
we were handed down the keys
let it rain let it rain
it was good enough for me and you
now i'll say a prayer for the good life
and i'm a son of a gun
knowin where it's at
i'm putting it back on solid ground
just to tear me apart
i could have learned
and that's not a crying feeling
to the bottom of it
we built our whole world on it (going digital)
catching rain in a paper cup
to meet mom and dad
but we always had our star
heart of gold with a silver lining
we came a long way through the valley
you took the wheel and you were
jack and diet coke
put (me) on ice
i've been waiting for a dime
when you move with me
when it comes down to us
waiting for a day that'll never come, 'cause
before she got married
to the watering hole
just waiting for the time
one day she was so sweet and kind
i'll strum some chords
we're just keepin it cool
pacing the floor, back and forth
here one day the next one she'll be gone
puttin in the past
trying to stick it out until the bell
'cause it's one step closer to the door
and when i'm too high up in the sky
they're gonna try to take it from me
we've been wrong enough
been to the east been to the west
oh sugar cover me with your love
or so i've heard
suddenly i can breathe a little easier
and we're just ghosts
time is now, on the mark
rolling round with lady luck
we never thought to settle for half full
and you're taking queens
i'll sing back two
we set our sails for diamonds in the blue sky
nothing we can do tonight is gonna save this love
no sweat on their skin
and i want to hold her tonight
i kept the bigger half
but i ain't ready to go
knocking on my stomach door
shining there just out of our reach
you're there when i need ya
you got whiskey with your eggs
bring it on (bring on it)
that our story ends
when i got endless days of rain
i'm shaking all over
so this time i'm never gonna doubt it
that a love falls down
it will always be there
from the ashes to the rising
the saving of a dark heart
strange love, bubbling up
driving with the pedal down
the train leaves today
wash away this scorched earth
and it was all a world they'd never seen
can't stay, can't go
i'll tell you i'm yours
take me or leave me or leave me alone
got nothin on ya
til the end of time
cold chimay by the sunset
like an angel crashing down
here again, on a razor's edge
someday i'll see her on the cover of a magazine
i'm coming back to that good old place
uh no oh, ay ay ay
making it last in love
ya get what ya give
while you're still drunk than me
it's gonna find somebody
tell me bout it someday baby
it's been too long
we still can't tell if it was a dream
been chasing memories around
put a little coffee in my cup
you're the one i dream of when i lay awake
my heart cupped in my hands
to call it off
love me or leave
and i know that i've been living with some ghosts
was a penny and
found the raft, sank the boat
wanna hold you in my arms right now
the haters, the traitors, the tinkers and the tailors
don't stand a chance
i found the genie in the lamp
in front of you without making a sound
working on a case of you
didn't know i was in love with her
before we ever learned to walk
your party will go on when i'm gone away
we already got it
come save me from these ghosts
a little bit of cattle, a little bit of hat
you are the truth
swimming through an endless sea
it could be much more than it seems
i got a boat
gonna send it to the stars (alright)
waiting for the good life to show up
living in a silent scream
but they showed us the door
'cause i tried to make a deal with the devil
down with the cause
jump on a train
it's time to move on to the real life
you were the dream i could have in this world
writhing in your chains
and i looked around
and i found a room with a view
i'm falling backwards and you're slipping away
and i know how much it hurt
i'm just making my way back home to you
darkness comes in fast
did i go too far
i can't stop these little voices in my head
cream in your coffee
some things you thought would be around forever
skies set on suns, moons rose from trees
they gave us the keys
and there's no easy way around it
and it's got me
we got world's there to see
is a love song drifting from an open door
always one step behind
million nights on the road
i'm gonna keep on chasing these beautiful lies
going off, as we run
if you didn't want the first
if we can't make this work, then baby
they're never gonna like
is that the way
i didn't get the message
long way down down down
for one more try
don't quit your day job
with a silver tongue
lost myself trying to find
seems like forever but nobody's counting
on the shining dime it spent
but this ain't mine
like a flame in the wind
hell or high water
find the exit out
here is the house that i built for you
all the little things you do
picked my soul up at the lost and found
we ain't got nothing on the birds and the bees
i don't wanna sit around getting older
lay me down in your arms
i'm under the radar
but even that wouldn't be enough
i had the feeling you would answer
take me where i belong
but now they've all gone away
meet me there and help me fill the void
and hoping for the best
i gotta say to you
and the summer came and went
one road came and another went
but they took everything you gave em
is one step closer to my grave
and i gave it all i got
and i'm trying to ignore
and sometimes when the feeling takes over
queen of the underground's headed up
your fire can not be contained
with my feet on the ground
you paint the colors on a cloudy sky
i'm just another boy who needs a girl
don't look at me
too late for the nick of time
gonna make it my own
take it out to the end of the line
i'll live forever in this memory
you were the one i thought that i knew
bending the moments to my will
walk down to the corner store
if you gonna break my heart don't do it twice
take the show back home
jump in the river like two foo-oo-ools
last all our lives
i waited up for you
it's time to let it all go
putting on these pants one leg at a time
a lot like you
but i never felt the way i feel with you
driving down highways of
better off without you
we had bills to pay
there's gotta be something else
and i'm ready to get nothing
goodbye to new york city
with my head up in the clouds
want her by my side
i got plans for the rain
that same palm tree
while the loving's good
just keepin it cool ooh ooh
magnets pointed at my heart
'cause i couldn't make yesterday last
i can't take it back
i still got this feeling
i took staten island
don't want to be like this, get a grip
shadow of the city
just waiting 'round for the end to come
but one road gone is another's found
holding out for a little luck
hold on just a minute
one shot of glory
just walk out that door and get you free
now i want you to be here again
that somehow we're both gonna lose
like a radio song
into a mountain of
but it's too late for holding
like you'll never be back
to drown out that feeling
one in a million stroke of luck
at least we'll say we took the long way down
fades into the scenery
looking up 'cause it's a long way down
but i gotta take it where i can
i got my life
i can't get enough of you
now i can see past my own eyes
far away from here
of strip malls and heartaches
headed somewhere else and nowhere fast
down-hearted queen on your way up
make it to the other side
the (time) - train, eg the 12:05, 9:09
been where i am and been where you wanted
you're my candy lovin'
'cause i couldn't read your signs
trying to hold my candle up high
i know how it ends up
throwing fits in the dark
and i thought about the times we spent
badda bing badda boom
but i still got the will
and the angels holding on for dear life
trying find a moment
you can change yourself
take it out to the edge of the world
all i know is i can't live without it
cents richer (and we're all a little dumber for it)
drowned in my tears too many times now
but the day is new
birds and the bees
writing our own storybooks
so many thens keep us from now
one glass of beer one glass of wine
just some peace of mind
been to the dance but i couldn't sweat
of a man always out of key
and find a way
and if you're head's stuck in the clouds
looks like another two-bit saturday night
gonna find a ladder up to cloud nine
monkey in a barrel
you could steal a little piece of heaven tonight
been to the cross but i couldn't hang
somehow my face wound up on a banana peel
here tomorrow gone today
one foot in the unknown
another lonely lonely life
do whatcha gotta do
save me a place in your heart
now i won't give up when the time's get tough
ten years to come and you're never alone
is the good life there to find
you can make the sun shine harder
what the hell am i doing lord
king for a day
running fingers through my hair
holding on to the arms of a stranger
it won't fit between these lanes
got some funny feelings sneaking up inside me
but i need you in my arms tonight
and if you be my marilyn monroe
just seeing things the way you want em to be
let's get away from this place
i was only trying to breathe
let me out of your doghouse tonight
is you love me a little bit too
you were just a bump on the road to freedom
thousand miles in front of
calling me through my stomach walls
and remember my name
kicking up dust since the day i was born
been on me knees but i had no prayers
i've been looking for someone a lot like you
where loneliness and harmony collide
i don't even need to know
and love is a one way dead end street
we can't go on this way
don't let em say that you're crossing the line
right where i started from
turtles all the way down
but it's heads-down hands-up hail-mary
where it ends up
all i want is that feeling again
fast talking, slow walking, two-timing man
'cause everyone's a stranger now but you
she got the sails up high
there's nothing left to long for
from the left coast to the right coast
a little bit of loving's a whole lotta nothing
take a picture of my face
i'll find a way now to live for today
when i got lightning in my eyes
and everybody's got an axe to grind
running for the exits
i've been standing here
so if they point to signs
this breaking of my heart
'cause it's one foot in the real world
has only got me turned around
or is my time already up?
i could fall in love with the way
girl so i'm fog town bound
to fall in love
i'm stuck inside a bad dream
think on it (just a little bit)
on making a mess of me
(stuck) between a rock
i kept my head afloat
and everything you get is more
going down a one way track
words come stammering out
love is lost but when it's found
and if you're feeling it too
when i hear that trumpet calling
i'm in with the queen
stick a fork in it
looks like it's gonna be
and if you wanna start a fire
i'm shaking all over for you (ooh ooh)
she's meeting me on an outbound train
while the neighbors are sleeping
the shadows of love
straight as ya gonna be
and babe i'll call you in the morning
something i never dreamed
it doesn't matter anymore
and i know a fire from the light
gonna set a fire
to end up where i began
to get me through this life
so whatever gets ya in the groove
too bad for yesterday
i'm tired of looking for things i can't see anyway
let the sky cry all our tears
sweat on my forehead
holding out for the arms of a stranger
'cause you and me, ooh ooh
stay in bed sleeping in forever
and a million sad refrains we sang before
i walked through the fire
a cowboy needs a sunset like the dessert needs rain
and rode off to the setting sun
you don't need to waste your time
you were the one that would never go out
headed in the right direction
and now the ribbons are falling out of the sky
maybe it's not for everyone
now that you are through with me
it's time to let it go (pain, love, the past)
you can take my love
i knew right from the start babe
there, before the altar of the past
no one showed up for the end of the world
giving it my best shot babe
time to take the devil down
cruel world's been closing in
and i would have waltzed right off into the night
and i ain't got the heart to miss ya
been to the back rooms
ice cracking in your veins
'cause every day it's cutting me
you and me, we're keepin it cool
'cause i'd rather be a fool for a fool
to the other side
i'm just trying to make my way to mrs make-it-right
can i find the good good life
time will, crash in, to the shore
i've been waiting on the right time
wrote a message on the bathroom wall to myself
i'm just waiting for a sign
here comes another one just like the other one
you're on a one-way track
let me stay here resting in your arms
i wanna move with you
next day she had changed her mind
how soon (we forget)
like a tidal wave
underneath that same palm tree
say goodbye to your friends
you know i never asked for roses in my garden
to take a broken heart
method to the madness
there was a time i thought i'd find
and finding that there's no one left to repay it
'cause one minute love is here
back at the wind
oh oh back to you
badda bing, badda boom
one minute here, the next one it's gone
i could have died
one step away from the door
gone, the best things never seem to last
you and me, we're just pieces of the broken dream
so i'm coming to my senses now
driving backwards and i
what if we never close the circle
pot of gold on a rainbow ramp
and every day i'm a little more free
one foot in the mud
short of a happy meal
the things you want to hide
and i can't hide how i feel
we got we got we got got today
but i ain't lie like a zombie in your arms
i just wanna get out of your doghouse tonight
check off your list
and i'll kiss the shore one more time
just another two-bit saturday night
a little bit of heartbreak knocking at your door
only came out knowing one more answer
two more bullets from a loaded gun
til i'm all yours
he traveled oceans, swam through puddles in the dark
cut off your nose
'cause it's slim pickin's
when the day is new
then he brings you flowers
'cause it's a one way dead end road
in every heart is a silence that's waiting
i only want her more
and loving on a one way dead end street
i'm only gonna fall a little more
'cause i've lost my self control
been to the river but it wouldn't roll
and i ain't got the time for this 'cause
we've got to dream the only dream that matters
but it was only words thrown to the wall now
but keep your hands off me
everyone is sliding down the trap staircase
fast talking, slow walking, two timing man
half way to something
and take these moments as they come
tell me who'll wear your boots when you are gone
step by step down the road of time
i was a ghost on a train passing through
we always knew that this road was dangerous
by a choir of the lovestruck and the drunk
'cause i got a few more things left in
been in the shadows, walked in the sun
i ain't asking for a promise
there's nothing to go back to
back in the valley again
it's time to let that bird fly
it's your turn at bat
i'm gonna drown in it
excuse me baby did you hear what i said
blanket of the night
i'm coming down from the hills
this bomb is ready to blow
we ain't never gonna live this down
and they're lining up my ride to the other side
it's too late for us now
driving it backwards every day
we were living in an afterthought
every light i held was a candle's flame
penny for your thoughts
makes me question things i thought i knew
no i ain't doing that dance
throw me back out into the world
you to knock on my door
looking at your style
and they built that life for us
i got it easy
drove down the road til i ran out of gas
breathe, beat, see, feel
half the world's just getting by
another lifetime for your loving
they don't have a piece of mind to give
well you may have thought i was gone
and i never wanted it to be this way
to make this all worthwhile
so let's go up to the top of the world
if you make your own sun
and left me here to say (that)
taking the night back
makin the night last
some people change your life and never say good bye
i think i'm gonna get me one
gonna throw my hands to the sky
gotta find a way out of this town
they'll catch you lying flat on the pavement
when the world has come to an end
she's got everything i need
scoobee doo (bee doo)
at the end of the rope
and i know we said goodbye
you might have thought i was born yesterday
looks like another two-bit saturday night (alright)
'cause part of me knew how it'd end
though blue suburban skies
let it come back to you
straight from source of pain
down in the dumps on your way up
we don't wait for clouds to break
(more than i can) shoulder
got places to be
knew it was time to let this go
back to the dream
and they made our plans, so we're making them back
and let you ride the horse all day
when the sun is shining i'm burning up (mm hm)
a whole lotta time (is watcha staying for)
one step to another, one step out the door
take the doubts now down in to the river
missing our life waiting for your call
wicked woman, hella man
back where i came from
those jeans made us look fat
and found a way to her heart
give me a little piece of your sunshine
let em loose and run em down
and treat her the like queen bee
i'll be back here with you again
oh, ship it you fool
take it down a notch
calling all the big dogs out
we can say it was our own
baby i'm an outbound soul
say it to my face
and i'm always on the edge of my seat
back to where we were
and let's go up and fly to the sun
it's high time that i burned my bridges down
'cause lord knows when it all goes down
if you got a bone to pick
to keep me holding on
you're the party one
this can't go on
you'll be alive when you live in the light
catches up to me
and please won't you tell me
when love's the only thing we know
i'd live another life
i'm down in the valley losing my mind
but hello, pleased to meetcha, and goodbye
wind blowing back her hair
and today all the stars have gone away
'cause i can't stand living with a clock that's ticking
say what ya wanna or nothing at all
don't worry about it
we can make a long story short
running in circles til i was spent
taking the last train out
'cause the only way over is up
gonna paint by numbers 'til i make you mine
with one hand on the trigger
then pack your bags and make like a tree
but sling back your whiskey and hope for the best
from now until forever
she's stuck on automatic
the gods got something on me
it's called gettin in the act
last mile of love
gonna jump the next train
someone wake me up when the end is come
'cause it's a short walk to your bed
there was a time i thought i would die
gonna hit the bottom before we find our way
i'm better off alone
now they're taking down the ribbons down from the sky
i've got no life to go back to
and you never paid them any mind
i said baby (baby)
you held the hoops and i jumped through the fire
it's kinda hard to let go
to live this again and again
'cause if i can't have you
my head up high
i took the beads
shooting through my body
can't let it get away
it could be the story of your life
are coming round my way
gonna make ya mine
you're the quiet one
she's got a way of standing on the chimney
december morning in the falling snow again
is ever gonna end
never knowing what i missed
or make me believe
and the time has finally come
i just got it
in glove in arms
and i'm sure there's all kinds of reasons
so i can see
i said hey yo (hey yo)
now you can chase love out to hell and back
i've been taken over by this strange fascination
the best things in life are free
leaving it all behind
you don't need to say goodbye
you're just a fast talking, slow walking, two timing man
i'm sitting on the highest cloud
one world to put a dent in
if you're headed up
i gotta ticket to my doom
oh no now i got to go
you're looking at me with those puppy dog eyes
i've spent too long in the darkness now
she came and went, now she's all i see
there could be something better
so we're taking it back
been to the right and been to the left
stuck on my own running out of time, 'cause
boiling over, cutting through
a little deeper to the bone
followed the road down to the end
i want her here with me
call it a night, wait for the light
with a drop of water
wanna be a star
i know it's there
and let it fall to the ground
so if you're gonna get outta town
mayor of haight st
everybody trying to fill the void
lay cards on the table
looking for the promised land
to soak up the sun
so at least would you leave with your knife
i've been trying not to slow down
'cause it's more than i got left in me
been to the temple but i couldn't pray
i can't make guarantees
living in a teenage dream
she's got the world on a string
that you glow when you say
taking the world as it comes
and you've done nothing to make me care
i've been working on the low-down
it's out of control can't make it stop
adding up the yesterdays
how can i a find a way back
i'll be waiting right here for you
let me out of your doghouse
you can't put my ship in a bottle
are gonna get me some day
breathe it in, let it go, take it back
now let me out
give me a place to call home
i cursed the candle light
sleep in your eyes
like i'm 8 years old again
i can't be alone for the rest of time
i can't promise you i will keep
live for the fight
'cause baby when you say goodbye
foot in your mouth
now we've been shakin the ceiling
so i'm gonna take the devil down
you took me in
now you're gone, and i'm
waiting for this long forgotten love
well it's high time now
been a life waiting for
one way or another i'm gonna make it alright
so go on and take it back
just a prince charming
fill the empty space
do it when the time is right
landed right on me (ooh woo)
gonna get my train back onto the track
but we always wanted more
now tomorrow's coming through
and take these moments one by one
no one needs our innocence
we'll never have again
'cause they never gave you nothin
gonna watch it til it's gone (alright)
beyond this sea of lights
ride this wave to the other side
put it on your nightstand
til i shed off this frown
ashes to ashes, love to love
but if you want to get back in my heart
it's time to get on with it now
so they can paint their lines
we can keep on trying but the nick of time
'cause we're taking it back
the other in the pan
then i hit rock bottom and bounce
i saw it comin' from a
show me watcha feel
that can keep the sunshine out
stuck in your head
staring at the tv, 24 hours of nothing much
right from the start
you're the guarded one
things are so different here now that you're gone
we learned to start over again
she, alone, wanting, reaching out
got the radio blasting my song
everyone i held was a ghost
give it all i got
if i weren't here talking to you
is a funny thing
wake me up uh huh
but i don't want to know oh oh oh oh
but i'm trying to keep
how did i wind up singing for your personal choir?
i'm sick of all the games
i was just wandering into the dark
we might as well get higher than life
elvis has left the building
can i have a moment with you?
those hard times come and go
don't let em slow you down
still just a little late
i'm stuck in the valley again
you make me feel uh huh everything more
hit the ground runnin' in the nick of time
that i'm with you (you you you fell out)
where the sun meets the shine
i always wondered if
so i'm not falling endlessly
all this talk of the promised land
we got one day at a time
get me up with the sun
throw me a line
i can't tell one feeling from another
it's never gonna be enough
but now those skies are falling down, and i'm
paint me a sky of blue
but i'll be coming down
one foot for another
and i refuse to be a fool for a fool
i found a home where i can lay
what difference does it make?
seen pretty covers and real good books
and the sky's so clear tonight
blind leading the blind
they're lining up straight out the door
come out from under your bed
so i'm headed out
see my poems all were made to be sung
i wasn't born with a broken heart
it won't make it any slower
threw my caution into the wind
i've been waiting for some
try it on for size but the shoe don't fit
you'd go better with me
but i wear this desire like tattoo
you were heaven sent hell bent
you had a message
right where i'm s'posta be
i'm just waiting on the
out the door (back door)
just enough to start a fire
i know i never asked for roses in my garden
same town different me
right back at the start
gotta take whatever comes my way
show me how ya feel
taking out the dollar bills
take the show on the road
the best in ya
but i got no worries anymore
find the holy grail
you were the one song i could sing
the fire and the rose
and it don't matter if i laugh shout or cry
i can't love back when i'm on my knees
and baby i'm an outbound soul
then you're barking up the wrong tree
i just want a fat chance
we'd better use this all up right here and now
one foot at home
hello to the skies of blue
if we drift apart
i ain't got the blues, i just ain't got you
hey hey babe i know that it's la-ate
i've got some living left in this life of mine
when you've fallen in love with a lesbian
holding on to what's left of my soul
looking for a needle in a haystack
and take a little step out your front door
who'll stir the pot and cook the beans
you don't need say goodbye
please won't you tell me
forget the roses oh baby i know this
but i ain't never gonna slow down
back in the saddle
i don't need a miracle just yet
need a little bitta help here
that baby i'm as gone as you
when you arrive and you're living that life
pick up the pieces
she'll make you roll the dice
it's too late for me now
out on the other side
four door car with a tank of dreams
to the grave and from the cradle
you look at me that way
trying to get back to the place we were before
waiting for some love
all that i'm asking
same story different time
seen the plans they were overrated
part of the plan
you got boil in your blood
i've been trying to make my way to mrs make-it-alright
down on my luck
then turn up the radio
who'll fill the pantry when you leave
bringing up the morning in my arms
'cause i put so much into this
i ain't ready to go
i hope we can be friends some day
well ashes for ashes and dust for your dust
if i come to be senses
i know a genie from the lamp
it's such a selfish kind of love that we need
i can finally see you blinding bright
and i'm trying to ignore it
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
let it pour let it pour
six more feet under the ground
so i can be your joe dimaggio
take it with you
you could pretend i was born with a brave heart
i prayed until my hands caught fire
don't let em try to
building a castle of desire
and my feet stuck in the ground
waiting for the good life
you you you let me be everything that i want
i'd raise a glass to the lost loves
now i wanna make something to last
you're gonna throw your reputation down the drain
it ain't the high life
and burn in each others arms
to find a pod for their pea
see the end of it
didn't mind going blind
she's walking out of the skyline
'cause i've been thinking bout ya girl
and let me stay here in your memories
and i aint trying to chase the moon
but it's time to let them go
everything i knew turned the other way
'cause there's real love to do
head's up in the clouds
make it to the promised land
if you're thinking like that then baby you thunk right
you're gonna have to come back to the city someday
maybe they'll come back like lost birds do
to keep me where i'm supposed to be
the one they told us of some day
well baby you can play
the seas and all that stirs within them
those stories never come true
turned out i'm better off without ya
hey now when it comes down to it
it's not a crying feeling
and emotion in the pure
there's no love out there
hope they saved us one more ever after
south of the border
settle for the night
from the flames that turned to ice
catching rain in a paper cup (oh oh oh)
and my hands start shaking, my heart starts racing
and i ain't coming down
they're tired of running away
but the sky's so clear tonight, you can see
hella (long way down)
i still got stars in my eyes
'cause your world revolves around you
the the players, the fakers, the smooth operators
if you believe the dream is never lost
at least would you leave me a rope
shit out of luck
i don't care if i'm wasting time
before it takes you
gotta a whole lotta nothin tonight
all i know is i know what i need's
riding off to the sun
this train is glory bound
birds of a feather
it's just a little bitta country love
i know that you feel it
woke up still dreaming and i got to go again
let's drive off together
it's gonna be okay
everything good is still out there waiting
i've been keeping my foot down on the gas
gotta burn some bridges down
let me stay here in a moonlit scene
made up my mind
but it was only sparkles on the water
can you feel me
i've been burning the candle of our love
clear as i'm gonna see
lost in the weeds since the day i was born
the fire outside my door
another log burning on your fire
'cause if i can't be yours
trying to make her go a little faster
and i don't know what became of us
'cause even you're a stranger to me now
let's get it started
girl 'cause no one else can save me now
lost queen, wandering the earth
baby i'm just fog town bound
gotta mind to throw it all away
back here to be with you again
i've got a feeling it all comes down to this
and baby i'm just fog town bound
ooh ooh how could i tell her goodbye
rain on your parade
wrapped up in a bow
of your love to give
you keep your boys out on the run
the three loud noises
the best from ya
why didn't i see what i had
livin in the past
and put the key into your lock
until the fat lady sings
you're a bad bad man
i said hey ya (hey ya)
to the kingdom of the blind
wondering how low i can get
to make my own way out
sometimes it just comes out that way
or one step closer to the grave
and everybody's telling me
right back where you started from
they're gonna live it anyway
tryin move heaven and earth
and when i feel the fire, i see the light
trying to find a home in this world
we used to make our way together through the wilderness
hook (line and sinker)
they sold the dream then broke our hearts (going digital)
to find the world's just same as i left it
beggars can't be thieves
it's too late to care what you do
she got the magic carpet ride
to keep it 55
you're spending all your karma on fair-weather friends
drowned in these blues
fly it down, let it go, cut it loose,
slippin' in, slidin' up
i'm losing my mind
appears out of a foggy mirror
won't you save a ray of light for me
load the prius with
i'm not made of
is what i wanna do to you
no visions in the night
got me in a cold sweat
back on the case
saw a sight from the corner of my eye
or how many nights i prayed
but real life is knocking
she got her voodoo spell hanging over me
playing with a full deck (of love)
love is only a start
so if they tell ya
for a light to shine through the dark
and if they tell you now
'cause ya know there ain't no one else
that can bring a good man down
'cause now they're on you like a hound
to keep me satisfied
we're gonna live in the light
i'm shaking all over for you
and you don't need to waste your time
feeling it to my bones babe
but if you play the cards just right
your dreams will not be denied
benny the jet is a good friend of mine
'cause you going to my head
is that lightning gonna strike
i've been spinning round in circles
and i went blind but now i see
johnny blue jeans is living undercover
you got burned by the fire you walked into
sank the boat, kept the raft
where we can search for gold
pretty cover on a real good book
it's poetry in motion
hey buddy i could drown in my beer
and i'm praying we can figure this out
with the sunday morning all-stars
but there's nothing i can do or say now
make a long story short
we learned to live the homeless life
i've felt the fire and i've seen the light
a thousand miles away
i got all my ducks lined up girl
but their memory will always carry on
but i'm just a poor player acting out the part
maybe i just want to know you're lonely without me
seventh son of a seventh son
life in a donut hole
to put away your broken heart
well you can't walk that line
i'm fed up with the tears
a love song drifting from an open door
somewhere the trains don't go
and i'm long gone
now the bad's still bad but the good ain't better
swallowed your pride too many times now
to do before i'm all set (before i lose it)
make me a place in your heart
we were a dot, a lie in our own ways
name rhyme (please louise)
'cause the real world's at my door but
you're the one who gives
as we stood here floating over time
and we always had the comfort of each other's arms
got the stars set in her sights
and ended up somewhere we didn't want to be
'cause you been hanging up all my moons
is kinda like waiting for the end of the world
everything bad comes back around
i'm just trying to get through to you
left me in pieces
the memories are bitter but bring me back to you
you can take him back
left the great out there behind
and that's a long way to come
take it or leave it
running backwards through your dreams
waiting for that moment
but i couldn't make yesterday last
best of both worlds
'cause i'm already all in
this here's a message from the bottle to the ship
i can't get too much of you
than to live my life without you
wasn't it gonna get a little better?
through oceans and winters
here's a message from the bottle to the ship
cover me with your kisses
i'm tired of playing dumb
got a golden ticket, you're not the only one
drop of a hat
givin' it my best shot
for the clouds to break apart
sitting on these words of mine
love won't keep us together
that you and i could fly away together
all the roads lead to one
so we can get to the good part
i have no power in me
just trying to find me a mrs make-it-alright
at your big time, big time, big time, big time
if the one don't get ya the other one will
'cause everything that's real never left
she's got the wind at her back
we gotta dance while the music's still playing (loud)
for the rest of my heart
the sea is endless but you're not sailing it
don't put away your broken heart ooh ooh
i ain't trying to change the world
one foot sinking deeper
'cause every step i take that isn't out the door
just trying to stay afloat
it's all a blur to me now
you had yours, now i'll go get mine
in the endless sea
and ran away to a life in the country
alone and alive we said
because it makes my life complete
that made me real
got a mind to throw it all away
i was sitting around waiting for some day
bending this moment to my will
down to the last drop
he fell on rain
but i don't want yours
show me the door
she can see straight through to another life
if you want a good time
come together, no delaying
now raise me up
back when the whole world was new
i know they will
but i've been waiting for you
how come life can't just be easy?
you wake up one morning and they're gone
with their blank stares
getting in the act
i want you so that i can be myself
out here on the diamond sea
before they can turn it back
i want i want tomorrow
when it gets in you
throw it on the wall but it just won't stick
one day we'll make it
gonna shout it to the mountains (alright)
but you're the one who said that
she's got the knick and she's got the knack
so we're going digital
living in each other's light
i'm over getting over
ain't got one beat for you beating in my heart
i always thought that fate would rescue me
put in a frame
under a rock or just by dumb luck
to see all that the world has got to give
building a castle in crazy town
and two feet in the
when you're smiling at me
just come here and get a whole lotta me
tell me whatcha want
no pot to throw it all in
i'm gonna find my way to the bottom of it
so you found a smooth talker
of the endless race it's just
everything's gonna be ok, if ya
if you wanna lay down, better lay down dead
we could learn to like
even happier than we were told
jumping off the end of the line
and wondering if this road
they don't have a better life to live
don't expect to make it out alive
a bottle of wine
i'm afraid that i will try
i'm running out of time
you might have thought that i was born yesterday
and i'd raise a glass to the old friends
the gods got one on me
all my friends been saying
find our side of paradise
if we can find a way
just like the other one
i'm going down with it
one day i swear it's gonna be behind me
all this shit bout me
until you come to the end of road
gonna be the one who tells ya
born into a grave
the end of the end of the line
one shot of love heartbreak back
and gone too soon
they'll try take the credit
there's a word for that
yeah we're taking it back
better late than sorry
wanting more if ya
i got a lifetime to go
with the last one who got away
forever circling around her heart
that the end's in sight
sometimes i want to hold her
she's got the world at her beck and call
two steps closer to my grave
tell me all the things that i didn't know
and i want to remember the look in your eyes
i know i've been getting kind of shy
did i break your heart
everywhere i look i find
cast out to sea
and if not then it couldn't hurt
now i can see that all this time
i hear love's been going around
this time there'll be no apologies from me
stick a fork it
you wear it well
take a message, get back to em later (and just)
baby tell me how long can we kiss goodbye
'cause no love no pain will make you whole again
been seeing ghosts of you
i'll never get where i'm going
born into a crazy time
it's such a selfish kind of love
we're keepin it cool
i keep a little hope
we can't go one more day
baby just hold me close
you make me feel the beat of my heart
show me the truth in your eyes (lies)
but we kept walking til we wore out our feet
sing me a kiss
never was an easy road
worse than anything i've ever felt
we've come so far
our worlds are not the same
oh why can't it just be easy? (ooh ooh ooh)
fake it til you make it
love in a time of love
that you are mine
to keep it all inside
giving love its moneys worth
couldn't make it go away
then you fell out of the love tree (uh huh)
make me a home in your arms
taking over my daydreams
they sold us a bridge
ticking clock, shaking bomb
life at the end of the tunnel
and if you wanna make it fly
it was good, 'til it was bad
for us i know
one shot at redemption
'cause i've fallen in love with a lesbian
that's searching for a melody
you can be anyone
they've got nothing better to do
just you and me
whatever makes ya wanna move
show me an end to this road
that can keep me hangin round here
they all found their home in this world
the other side of the bell curve
on your case (on the case)
that's what you get
or just a poor player acting out his part
just keep these times in the back of your mind
ain't stealing light from the sky
and there's nowhere to turn but my own imagination
the next one she is gone
and i meant it, every word
and while i've been praying
tied up tied down under the gun
i got things to live for
so i'm gonna take the devil down!
if it was real, but who cares
ooh ooh why would i try?
building a home in your heart
tell me lord what i do this for
i wish i could die
i don't need a novel
working up a love
when that feeling's taking over
'cause i've been on this road all my life
so many waves between you and me
whatever this long road has waiting for you
no one wants another jesus
i walked through flames
and at very least
and the games they play can be such a bore
and i've been picking up a thing or two
ain't looking to get comfortable
but i've been around once or twice
i just now seen that smile
so still empty air
steam rising, blood boiling
waiting on things to come
before we say goodbye
you make me see things with my heart
your love is deep as it is wide
where the trains don't go
a whole lotta pain (is whatcha paying for it)
one page at a time
giving it all i got
you gotta swing for the fences
but it's heavy lifting
frannie lou, queen of hearts
a candle and a flame
and when the new day is finally in sight
so many islands out on the sea
i know the love from just one look
'cause i never felt the way i feel 'bout you
it's all a dream to me now
we all see what we want to see
how does it all go down
love of a brother
and i rolled into town in a '97 jetta
feeling it in my bones babe
he fell to earth, one day from the blue
and i'll call it hallowed ground
so he fell on rain
til i get it back
a long long time ago
i fall in love with your face
heating up, boiling over, running hot
i'm sneaking in the back door
but ain't ready to go
at the movies at the mall
funny feelings sneaking up inside of me
let's make a rhyme
i want more (i want more)
'cause if it's done then it's done
you can go anywhere you wanna go
i ain't looking for an answer
now i've been looking at a life for two
if i could feel that way one more time
and all your friends just roll their eyes
i'd make the same mistakes
give me the good life
do just what you want
and cupid's angels are packing it in
holding on to something i can't have
letting the chips fall down
so i ain't waiting (nah nah)
cast aways out on the sea
i'll be your joe dimaggio
but that'll only get you so far away
'cause i've been burned so many times
looking for the exit (sign)
i still haven't found what i'm looking for
'cause the story's gotta end your way
every lie i waited to come true
i know you're taking it slow
can i have the will to walk away
and i've had my chance to cry
the seed of doubt
ten years making my way out of a paper bag
making circles round her heart
oh baby i've been waiting for this day to come
and c'mon down to the old bar
i always wondered what hell had in store
i wanna be the one singing love songs with you
down in the dumps
you saw me coming
well i may have said i was dead
he fell on rain, found a way to her heart
there's no sunshine today
til i started singing her praises
and i will call it hallowed ground
past the tv, the tabloids, the radio talk
rising on the other shore
don't put away your broken heart
we're keepin it cool ooh ooh
talked to the shrink but he said i'm fine
she got the angel's smile and the devil's eye
yesterday went so fast
it happened one day
i'm gonna suffer without your love
you just gotta realize
got nothing now but a two-bit love
i found my muse in a human being
i don't know if the thrill is over yet
i ain't got the words (for that)
love in a time of
giving it back, loving me back
don't look at me that way
a whole lotta nothin (is whatcha getting from him)
and i'm blowing with the wind again
i know they're knockin at your door
we're going somewhere fast
a long long long long time ago
'cause i won't give you my whole life
i won't waste them away
doors were shaking and my foot stuck to the pedal
worth all the heartache
every little way you move
i ain't a lucky one
been a slog through the mud
but the clock's a-tickin'
and a sip of you
but you're gonna lose the war
'cause it all starts over
but you're never out of fires
while the good life sits right here
but i'll be right here at your doorstep
that's more than enough
my love ain't for your charity
play me a joyful sound
two eyes towards the sky
here at this bar with an empty glass
got me in her good graces
i had it coming, all this time
and living on paper is harder than it seems
who'll fill your pantry when i'm gone
and gets down on his knees
now i look stupid and you look inspired
we were washing our cats
long after we are gone
swing for the fences
me, undone, holding on to scattered hopes
you're always gettin' in then you're gettin' out
et me get this straight
leave the world we know
but life has a way of making you face
just one more day
if you're headed for a strike-out
for the red sea to part
cool to be cool and hot be hot
you were so hard to see
found the words but nothing comes out right
out in our own little world away from it all
emptiness inside me been reaching out to feel your touch
i tried to change
when i need a little blue
don't mean to say the things i say
holding on to what's left of my truth
who'll wind up your clock
'cause if you be my homecoming queen
crank the ac in the car
but i need you
tied up in a knot
so if they tell ya now
you got fire in your shoes
and ride this wave to the other side
cutting through the line
hey won't you send me a sign
when i was hoping that the end had come
if that's only thing you're giving me
and all i'm asking of you
'cause ya know that there's no one else
gonna pave the road with tears
but she only wants what she can't have (oh yeah)
and fell asleep on the floor
swayin to the music
but that didn't change the weather
she's coming back back back
and you wouldn't care either
and i know i left you first
the grief (and expression of) - blues
and you've come to the end
i'm already out the door
well i don't need another mountain to climb
and if you take her up on the ride
what the hell am i doing here
we could find eternity
i told you for the millionth time
it's never gonna be the same way for us
and i told 'em all to stop it
i've been cryin to the sky
fade a little every time i breathe
and i took wrong turn without an end in sight
but you left me on me knees
how can you have one more chance
til you're back where you started from
you gotta give everything you take
taking out the trash
i know the love from the look
i'm gonna stand high, throw my
when they call on you
i ain't got the time (for that)
turns out i'm better off without ya
another world that could have been
just press the pedal down harder
never gonna get enough of this
and cupid's angels are packing it up
wake me up to your love
put on your dancing shoes
but hello, pleased to meet you, and goodbye
in the popcorn machine
and throw it out into the wind
but when you need em they won't be around
been to the house but i couldn't stay
give me the will to walk away
i love the love but i can't take this shit
let's get out beyond these city lights
one road straight the other bent
but i never felt the way i feel tonight
looking for good company
it's gonna be alright
like the way you do
'cause these harmonies are so sweet
followed it in circles til i was spent
and i cried all i'm listening for
i'm on the shelf dear
i'm home sick for
real life as an afterthought
i'll go ahead and suffer
been to the mountain but i couldn't climb
but it can still be crossed
you were here and you were gone
'cause you're taking me over
work it on out
and i'll keep on listening for
i'm a force of nature
and nothing could keep them apart
take down your high 'cause you
loving ya with all my heart
where no one's been before
who'll listen to me
gonna make ya mine (uh huh)
oh baby i've been patiently waiting for you
you got steam coming from your hood
put it in your pocket
been all the way to hell and back
fill up the cup
uh no oh, ay ay i ain't doing that dance
no chance at more
and move on to the next life
and they can't make you drive at 65
and if you catch em trying
and we were only ships inside a bottle
whatever gets ya feeling high high high high high
here in a city
you're always 1, 2, 3 steps from the door
safe inside our mind's four walls
i thunk (it, you sunk it)
we were ready willing and able
take out your pen
you're moving on and i'm learning to breathe
til it came around again
steppin up to bat
running round in circles
and if the numbers come out right
time to step up to the real thing
it's an offer i can't refuse
sitting by my side
as we stand here floating over time
tingle in my skin
it will be here again
but you're just a stranger to me
baby stick with me
hitching a ride out on the wind
i've been flirting with the thought of moving on
sending us to kingdom come
we'll be back again
one shot of love (and two shots of heartache)
tell me what you want what you really really want
ain't wasting my time praying
to keep me from being too happy
one foot on the track
if i closed my eyes
takes a whole lotta love
but sometimes it takes a lot
the ribbons are falling right out of the sky
time will wear us down
into skies of blue
that our grace became our fall
oh oh, see this picture fade to black
see all the ways we could have lived that life
so take a tip if you wanna get outta town
and if you're looking for a happy ending
when you're looking at me with those puppy dog eyes
dam to break i know your
but say whatcha wanna
but i'm starting to feel that
one way or another
i always thought that my pain would set me free
why can't it just be easy? (ooh ooh ooh)
you can get low
saddle up and go
didn't know i was in love with you
gonna make ya mine (oh yeah)
ain't gonna come for us
we liked to say the beaten path wasn't for us
but that could be us
watching the world go by
and she is only passing through my little world
how come nothing's ever easy
cut you some slack
and you make make me feel everything more
we can't go on like this
been up and down these streets
baby i'll be gone as you
what i gotta do (to get through to you)
she got the wind at her back
they're just waiting here on you
i know how it goes
when that feeling comes back to you
gettin' on the case
tell me you're mine
talking to the neighbors
i ain't putting up a fight
my bucket list of dreams and
and i'll be yours
waiting out the storm
i was the one wondering why anyone would
you gotta move over
kick off your shoes
i've given up on the ghost of you
check up from the neck up
she's got the motor on
i've been taken over by a strange fascination
trying to dodge the rain
i can make it real
don't make me want what i can't have
shooting to the top
knee deep in quicksand
you make make me feel everything
i'm gonna think on it (just a little bit)
i made it in my mind
my heart beats out of time
now i'm just waiting for the end to come
all the things you do to me
when you are gone
i still speak to you in dreams
i only want you to stay
give me a break
gonna tip my hat
so close running scared
hanging over the good times
their names on the breeze
i've been waiting in the wings
sometimes the only way out is up
i'm gonna hit the highway
i got the hots and i'm sweating bullets
never thought i'd say that
in the shadows of the past
down to the wire
'cause my love is well-done
this day is never gonna end
and she might think it's a joke
you're giving to me
they don't want it if it's gonna be hard
working up the nerve to walk into the real world
what do i have to do
i ain't puttin' on no show
if you got a little bit
why can't it just be
finding new ways to
when my words aren't enough
loving you with all i got
when it comes down to it
following the path other had lead
bum bahm chakka chikki
you should have known
and tryin not to fall apart
the tears that fall like rain
ooh ooh how could i tell her?
i've got a message to the world
i'm slippin' backwards and you're falling away
and if i try to break up this fall
someday i'll ride that wind
it's gonna end up the same way
but yesterday went so fast (yesterday)
'cause i'm gonna need a whole lot more
when you're chasing your tail
i'm just trying to get through to the one girl
can't quit it (ya)
and we walk hand in hand
things are looking up but they ain't getting better
life on planet nine
in the pages of a storybook
to hold her like a kitten
and one foot on the ground
got a masters degree in something or another
without you by my side
and wild and free
i'll be gone as you
i'm getting there on my own
i'd do it all again
kiss me you fool
that's what i wanna do to you
hit the nail on the head
that i'm turning to jelly inside
you find the broken hearts put back together as one
never gonna be the same
now we're taking it back
i wanna be the one who lights your star
i hear the rhythm of love
where the sun don't shine
gimme some of your good sunshine
alone with the darkness
cuttin' to the chase
'cause every day my boat
say things about ya
ain't doing your rain dance
but if you go
yesterday went so fast (yesterday)
you make it ok
better safe than sorry
make two wrongs into a right
they're gonna try to make me do it
and treat her like a queen bee
here for the rest of my life
little piece of heaven tonight
who'll wear your boots when you are gone
i don't wanna talk it over
the other's running away
just think what your friends will say
and i can make it real for you
a little bit of you's a ticket to the blues
hey man it's gonna be alright
time to start over again
try to stick it out until the bell
believing we could fly
blazing a lonesome trail through the world
and lands right at my feet
but i can't see the sun
i had my fill and you had your fun
can you break my lonely fall
she didn't come with a warning
were painted on our hearts
i'll always feel that way
unlocked a door to nowhere
you'd never even see the shadow i could cast
burn some bridges down
rolled into town in a '97 jetta
so by all means have a nice day
she's got the training jumping off the track
until i finally found the place that i had left
i got an empty room with a better view
the truth was right under my nose
and i tried to fall in line
little coffee and jack
must, lust, such, much
but this moment won't last long
your castle in the sky
you've got to keep your control
now i'm running in circles and you're running away
and let it wash your sins away
and never even know
