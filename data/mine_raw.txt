storm is coming you’re down on your luck
catching rain in a paper cup
until the sun shines harder
just enough to start a fire

then pack your bags and make like a tree
four door car with a tank of dreams
just push the pedal down lower
til you’re cutting round those corners

and if they tell you now
to take the scenic route
don’t let em slow you down
this train is glory bound

ain’t nothin wrong with ya
wanting more if ya
wanna be a star
you can be anyone

don’t let em try to
take down your high cos you
ain’t stealing light from the sky
if you make your own sun

when you arrive and you're living that life
just keep these times in the back of your mind
cos it all starts over
but you’re never out of fires

and if you catch em trying
to cut you down to size
they’re never gonna like
your castle in the sky

and they can't make you drive at 65
so they can paint their lines
where the sun don’t shine

so if they point to signs
to keep it 55
well they can paint their lines
where the sun don’t shine

your dreams will not be denied
your fire can not be contained
your love is deep as it is wide
it won’t fit between these lanes

so if they tell ya
to keep it all inside

so if they tell ya now
to kick the devil out

down-hearted queen on your way up
down in the dumps on your way up
queen of the underground’s headed up
catching rain in a paper cup
you can make the sun shine harder
you’ll make the sun shine harder
just enough to start a fire

trains are all gone and the horses ...
four door car with a tank of dreams
just press the pedal down harder
it won't make it any slower

and when you arrive don’t remember these times
you’ll be alive when you live in the light
don’t let em say that you’re crossing the line
they’ll try take the credit
but you’re the one who said that


well you can't walk that line
to the other side


and it comes
like a train in the night
and it goes
like a flame in the wind
and I wait
here for the rest of my life
on that stranger to come round again

uh oh when she gets that feeling
oh no now I got to go
and I'm sure there's all kinds of reasons
but I don't want to know oh oh oh oh
I don't want to know oh oh oh oh
I don't want to know oh oh oh oh


[I'm just waiting for that stranger again]

bum bahm chakka chikki
bum bahm bahm

warm beer
it won't last for long
cos one minute love is here
the next one she is gone

I want more (I want more)
I wanna be the one who lights your star
(I want more)
I'm gonna drive off your cliff in a flaming car

don't look at me that way
don't make me want what I can't have
our worlds are not the same
you live it better on the other half

and if you save it for a rainy day
when it comes you gotta run the other way

you shouldn't be seen with freaks like me
just think what your friends will say
you shouldn't be seen with freaks like me
you're gonna throw your reputation down the drain

(woh oh oh oh oh) down the drain
(woh oh oh oh oh) down the drain

oh but anyway
you saw me coming
a thousand miles away

I've got a message to the world
I'm fed up with the tears
I'm sick of all the games
I'm tired of playing dumb

while the good life sits right here
wrapped up in a bow
tied up in a knot
waiting 'round for

someone to open the door
someone to boldly go
where no one's been before


I'm coming back
falling down from cloud nine
cutting through the line
gonna find my way to you
oh oh back to you

it's been too long
waiting out the storm
twiddilin my thumbs
wondering what wrong
oh oh I lost my mind

...

give it all I got
tell me whatcha want
I can make it real
gimme just a shot (uh oh)
at your big time, big time, big time, big time

give it all I got
tell me whatcha want
I can make it real
gimme just a shot (uh oh)
at your big time, big time, big time, big time

big time (uh oh oh)
big time (uh oh oh)
big time (uh oh oh)
big time

and it came
like a hurricane
left me in pieces
and it left
like a tidal wave
drowning in you
and it was
the only thing
worth all the heartache
it was the only way
I could have learned

it's a long way to the top
you're gonna get there, or you know you're not
cos it's a short walk to your bed
if you wanna lay down, better lay down dead

cos it's better late than never, if never never comes
you never were a quitter twiddling your thumbs
got a golden ticket, you're not the only one
cos no one really cares where you came from
(you only need)

a little bit of this, a little bit of that
a little bit of cattle, a little bit of hat
a little bit of skill, a little a bit of luck
takes a little bit of soul, and a whole lotta love

takes a whole lotta love
takes a whole lot, whole lotta love

darkness comes in fast
looking for the light, it's been looking for you back
cos the story's gotta end your way
a cowboy needs a sunset like the dessert needs rain

cos it's take it or ya leave it, or take it as it comes
but they never will believe it's your day in the sun
so you gotta take it to em, or take another punch
cos you never lose the fight if you're gettin' back up
(it only takes)

one step to another, one step out the door
one day I swear it's gonna be behind me
working up the nerve to walk into the real world
putting on these pants one leg at a time
you had yours, now I'll go get mine

one way or another I'm gonna make it alright
gonna find a ladder up to cloud nine
you were just a bump on the road to freedom
you were just a tick in the clock of time
now you're gone, and I am fine

and I ain't got the heart to miss ya
now that you are through with me
and I ain't got the time for this cos
my love ain't for your charity
and if you're looking for a happy ending
I can't make guarantees [there's nothing here to see]
but if you want to get back in my heart
then you're barking up the wrong tree

take me or leave me or leave me alone
gonna get my train back onto the track
say what ya wanna or nothing at all
but say it all now cos you can't take it back
it was good, 'til it was bad

hey won't you send me a sign
I'm waiting on you one day at a time


throw me a line
send me a sign

one more round
we ain't never gonna live this down

you might have thought I was born yesterday
cos I couldn't read your signs
and you might have thought I had nothing else to say
but hello, pleased to meet you, and goodbye

and I might have thought that you had a certain type
tall dark handsome and rich
and I would have waltzed right off into the night
never knowing what I missed

cos I've been on this road all my life
I've felt the fire and I've seen the light
I've been the fish and I've been the hook
seen pretty covers and real good books
but I never felt the way I feel tonight

I've got a feeling it all comes down to this
this life stops here, a new one starts with a kiss
and I want to remember the look in your eye
as we stand here floating over time
I've got a feeling it all comes down to this

I'd like to think I was born with a brave heart
bending these moments to my will
or just a poor player acting out his part
try to stick it out until the bell

and I took wrong turn without an end in sight
'til the only way left to go was right

I've got a feeling it all comes down to this
this life stops here, a new one starts with a kiss
and I want to remember the look in your eye
as we stand here floating over time
I've got a feeling it all comes down to this

but I've been around once or twice
I've felt the fire and I've seen the light
the kinda love from just one look
a pretty cover and a real good book
but I never felt the way I feel tonight

but I've been down this road once or twice
and when I feel the fire, I see the light
I know the love from just one look
a pretty cover and a real good book
but I never felt the way I feel tonight

you could pretend I was born with a brave heart
bending this moment to my will
but I’m just a poor player acting out the part
trying to stick it out until the bell

now you might have thought that this moment was heaven sent
one in a million stroke of luck

and I used up every way to get it wrong tonight

now I've been looking at a life for two
and I found a room with a view
I found the genie in the lamp
a pot of gold on a rainbow ramp
cos I never felt the way I feel 'bout you

you might have thought that I was born yesterday
'cause I couldn't read your signs
and you might have thought I had nothing else to say
but hello, pleased to meetcha, and goodbye

and I might have thought that you had a certain type
tall dark handsome and rich
and I would have waltzed right off into the night
never knowing what I missed

but I've been around once or twice
and I know a fire from the light
I know the love from the look
pretty cover on a real good book
but I never felt the way I feel tonight

'cause I've got a feeling it all comes down to this
this life stops here, a new one starts with a kiss
and I want to remember the look in your eyes
as we stood here floating over time
I've got a feeling it all comes down to this

you could pretend I was born with a brave heart
bending the moments to my will
but I’m just a poor player acting out the part
trying to stick it out until the bell

so if the poetry ain’t rolling off my tongue
maybe it's not for everyone
see my poems all were made to be sung
by a choir of the lovestruck and the drunk

and I’ve been picking up a thing or two
and I know a room from the view
I know a genie from the lamp
pot of gold on a rainbow ramp
but I never felt the way I feel with you

I’ve got a feeling it all comes down
I’ve got a feeling it all comes down
I’ve got a feeling it all comes down
to this

we got we got we got got today
now I want tomorrow

hey babe I can't find a way to make things right
I just wanna get out of your doghouse tonight

make two wrongs into a right

so I'm just trying to get out of the doghouse tonight

this here's a message from the bottle to the ship
the sea is endless but you're not sailing it
you're just seeing things the way you want em to be
just seeing things the way you want em to be

looking for a needle in a hay-stack


going down a one way track
never thought I'd say that
find a way back
laid back

you had a message
you had a message for me
you had a message
and you'd been trying to get through
you had a message
you had a message for me
well you may have thought I was gone
but I've been waiting for you

but now I'm here for you
but now I take it back
well I may have said I was dead

excuse me baby did you hear what I said
I can't stop these little voices in my head

you gotta move over
I'm a force of nature
and I'm blowing with the wind again

ya get what ya give
so this time I'm never gonna doubt it
it is what it is
all I know is I can't live without it
if I closed my eyes
wake up in the morning with you right by my side
I could have died ...
to live this again and again

put away my broken heart
I don't need it anymore
put away my broken heart
I don't need it anymore
I don't need it anymore...

I can't... get too much of you
all the little things you do
every little way you move
moves me too
I can't get too much of you
all the things you do to me
every way you make me feel
feels so good

if you got a bone to pick
if you got an itch to scratch
if you got a little bit
of your love to give
I'm gonna give it back
cos I've been thinking bout ya girl
I've been getting lost in you

trying to keep my cool
but that only proves

I can't get enough of you
every little thing you do
every little way you move
moves me too
I can't get enough of you
every little thing you do
every way you make me feel
feels so good

I've been spinning round in circles
trying to get back to the place we were before
back when the whole world was new
and every day was only hope
that you and I could fly away together
into skies of blue

but now those skies are falling down, and I'm

holding on to the arms of a stranger
waiting for the candle to burn out
holding on to the arms of a stranger
cos even you're a stranger to me now

you were the one I thought that I knew
you were the candle with the flame burning down
to my hands til I let it go
and let it fall to the ground

holding out for the arms of a stranger
holding on to what's left of my soul
holding out for the arms of a stranger
cos everyone's a stranger to me now

everyone I turned to turned away
every storybook was not for me
you were the dream I could have in this world
you were the one song I could sing

every light I held was a candle's flame
burning down til my hands let it go
you were the one that would never go out
now you're gone, and I'm

holding out for the arms of a stranger
holding on to what's left of my truth
holding out for the arms of a stranger
cos everyone's a stranger now but you

everything I knew turned the other way
everyone I held was a ghost
every lie I waited to come true
now I'm just a body waiting for a soul

holding out for the arms of a stranger
holding out for the arms of a stranger
cos everyone's a stranger to me now

you gotta come out from the shadows
stuck in your head
it's time to move on to the real life
come out from under your bed

cos the sun is rising in my world
and the light's shining through
I got all my ducks lined up girl
they're just waiting here on you

the haters, the traitors, the tinkers and the tailors
take a message, get back to em later (and just)

gimme watcha got
tell me what ya want
show me how ya feel
and I can make it real for you [x2]

ya gotta get into the right swing
put on your dancing shoes
time to step up to the real thing
get lost in the groove

the haters, the traitors, the tinkers and the tailors
take a message, get back to em later (and just)
the beggars, the players, the smooth operators
you can say that the check is in the mail (and just)

gimme watcha got
tell me what ya want
show me how ya feel
and I can make it real for you [x2]

(real for ya) I'll make it real for ya [x4]

and if you wanna start a fire
you gotta burn it down
and if you wanna make it fly
you gotta drive it with your pedal stuck to the ground

[solo: 2 bars | +1 bar unison bend | +1 bar unison bend modulate up step]

gimme watcha got
tell me what ya want
show me watcha feel
and I can make it real for you [x2]

(real for ya) I'll make it real for ya [x4]

you gotta swing for the fences
it's your turn at bat
go and do what you're meant to
put on your dreamer's hat

cos they never gave you nothin
...
but they took everything you gave em
so go on and take it back

been a minute in the fog
waiting on things to come
wasn't it gonna get a little better?
been a life waiting for
you to knock on my door
hurry up, put down those love letters

the haters, the traitors, the tinkers and the tailors
take a message get back to em later, just

give me a little piece of your sunshine
give me a little piece of your sunshine
give me a little piece of your sunshine
give me a little piece of your sunshine

been a slog through the mud
rolling round with lady luck
trying to make her go a little faster

throwing fits in the dark
ripping up storybooks
hope they saved us one more ever after

the haters, the traitors, the tinkers and the tailors
take a message get back to em later
the the players, the fakers, the smooth operators
you can tell em the check is in the mail and

give me a little piece of your sunshine...

well I don't need another mountain to climb
I'm down in the valley here, losing my mind (so won't ya)

give me a little piece of your sunshine...

but I still got the will
if we can find a way
I still got this feeling
everything's gonna be ok, if ya

following a shadow
always one step behind
come save me from these ghosts
I'm down in the valley losing my mind

I'm down in the valley losing my mind
gimme some of your good sunshine
I'm down in the valley losing my mind again

I fanned your fire
I walked through flames
All to play a losing game
I tried to change
It was all the same Without ya

I let it take me (I gave it all)
Went insane
To Hell and back on a round trip plane
Only came out knowing one more answer

Turned out I’m better off without ya
I’m better off without ya
Better off on my own
Turns out I’m better off without ya
I’m better off without ya
I’m getting there on my own

I tried to change
I jumped through flames
All to play a losing game
I’ll be ok
It just ain’t the same without ya

back here again
It’s all the same without ya

I could fall in love with your face
with those eyes that you make
when you're smiling at me

I could fall in love with the way
that you glow when you say
what you say but you can't see

that I'm turning to jelly inside [falling to pieces inside]
and I'm always on the edge of my seat
and I wish you would send me a sign
so I'm not falling endlessly

in love with a run-away dream
... but I'm trying to keep
my cool but it seems out of place
when every time that you smile
I fall in love with your face

hey my sweet
I can't follow you into the deep
but if you go
at least would you leave me a rope
'cause every day my boat
drifts a little farther from the shore

hey my sweet
I can't promise you I will keep
my head up high
so at least would you leave with your knife
'cause every day it's cutting me
a little deeper to the bone


there was a time I thought I would die
without you by my side
but life has a way of making you face
the things you want to hide

so I'm coming to my senses now
calling all the big dogs out
forget the roses oh baby I know this
the truth was right under my nose

that I'm better off without you (uh huh)
I'm better off alone
I'm better off without you (uh huh)
just a little bit better on my own
I'm better off without you (uh huh)
I'm better off without you (uh huh)
I'm better off without you

there was a time I thought I'd find
eternal happiness
under a rock or just by dumb luck
and hoping for the best

but I'm coming to my senses now
calling all the big dogs out
why pray to angels and shake magic eight balls
when everbody knows

that I'm better off without you (uh huh)
I'm better off alone
I'm better off without you (uh huh)
just a little bit better on my own
I'm better off without you (uh huh)
I'm better off without you (uh huh)
I'm better off without you [x2]

I can do the happy dance with two left feet
gonna hit the fast lane
gonna jump the next train
gonna take a walk to easy street

forget the roses oh baby I know this

I won’t bring roses cos baby I know this

there was a time I thought that I'd die without you loving me
but life has a way of making you see each new reality

sick of the hopeless cos baby I know this

we set our sails for diamonds in the blue sky
rising on the other shore
to be the happy after ever after
writing our own storybooks
but it was only sparkles on the water
shining there just out of our reach
and we were always jumping on the big waves
swimming through an endless sea
just looking for

love in a time of
love in a time of
love in a time of love
love in a time of
love in a time of
love in a time of love

take the doubts now down in to the river
and let it wash your sins away
we’ve got to dream the only dream that matters
the one they told us of some day


but it was only words thrown to the wind now
never getting anywhere
and we were only ships inside a bottle
waiting to be free one day

but it was only words thrown to the wall now
no one ever had their say
and we were only ships inside a bottle
waiting to be free one day

Another log burning on your fire
Another lover singing in your choir
It was Good enough for me and you
It was one more night that we made it through

I had my fill and you had your fun
Two more bullets from a loaded gun
But I don’t care bout the price to pay
Your party will go on when I’m gone away

And everybody’s got an axe to grind
But this ain’t mine

Tell me bout it someday baby
Tell me all the things that I didn’t know
Tell me bout it someday baby
When I don’t care bout you no more

You keep your boys out on the run
Tied up tied down under the gun


those hard times come and go
and just make you better for it

so don’t put away your broken heart
don’t put away your broken heart ooh ooh
don’t put away your broken heart
‘cause there’s lovin’ left to do
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
‘cause there’s lovin’ left to do
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
‘cause there’s lovin’ left to do

so many islands out on the sea
so many waves between you and me
we can’t go on this way
so far apart

so many thens keep us from now
so many walls we could have knocked down
we can’t go one more day
fighting for love [running from love]

so let’s go up to the top of the world
and fall like two drops of rain
and take these moments one by one
‘cause it's never gonna be the same

never gonna be the same
feeling as this one
never gonna be the same
feeling as this love


and let’s go up and fly to the sun
and burn in each others arms
and take these moments as they come
‘cause there's never gonna be a feeling like this one


it’s never gonna be the same way for us
it’s never gonna be the same thing as falling in love
I’ll meet you where the trains don’t go (oh oh)
out in our own little world away from it all
say goodbye to your friends
we’ll be back again
when love’s the only thing we know
that’s where the trains don’t go oh oh
that’s where the trains don’t go oh oh
where the trains don’t go

she’s walking out of the skyline
wind blowing back her hair
she’s meeting me on an outbound train
but she can take me anywhere

take out your pen
I’ll strum some chords
let’s make a rhyme
tell me you’re mine
I’ll tell you I’m yours
that didn’t take so long

sing me a kiss
I’ll sing back two
‘cause these harmonies are so sweet
singing with you
and if you’re feeling it too
baby c’mon
let’s make a love song

those stories never come true
but don’t put away your broken heart
‘cause there’s real love to do



living through the end of times
building a castle in crazy town
waiting for the good life to show up
like an angel crashing down

and loving on a one way dead end street
has only got me turned around
driving it backwards every day
’til I'm back at the end of the road

I’m just waiting for the nick of time
holding out for a little luck
is that lightning gonna strike
or is my time already up?

---

I didn't get the message
there could be something better

I was sitting around waiting for some day



I waiting around for you to come my way



---




til you’re back where you started from

holding out for a stroke of luck


living in the strangest kinda times
will get you half-way to crazy town
waiting for the good life
is kinda like waiting for the end of the world

and love is a one way dead end street
it'll get ya just a little turned around
driving it backwards every day
until you come to the end of road





---

is the good life there to find

can I find the good good life
is there love out there to find]


---


jumping off the end of the line

---


the end of the end of the line
‘cause lord knows when it all goes down


...
I was a ghost on a train passing through
trying to find a home in this world

but yesterday went so fast (yesterday)
yesterday went so fast (yesterday)
I was okay keeping up with today
now I wanna make something to last

---

I was just wandering into the dark
trying to hold my candle up high

is that the way
that our story ends
half way to something
we'll never have again
is that the way
that a love falls down
in front of you without making a sound
it's too late for us now


Yesterday went so fast
Yesterday went so fast
I’ll find a way now to live for today
'Cause I couldn’t make yesterday last

I’d raise a glass to the lost loves
If they’d remember me
And we’d drink a toast for the foolish old ghost
Of the man that I used to be

And I’d raise a glass to the old friends
But now they’ve all gone away
They all found their home in this world
And left me here to say (that)

Yesterday went so fast
Yesterday went so fast
I’ll find a way now to live for today
'Cause I couldn’t make yesterday last

Now I’ll say a prayer for the good life
Someday may it find me
Here at this bar with an empty glass
humming an old melody

Yesterday went so fast
Yesterday went so fast
I’ll find a way now to live for today
'Cause I couldn’t make yesterday last
I know they say that it never goes away
But I couldn’t make yesterday last
I couldn’t make yesterday last

you might win the battle
but you’re gonna lose the war
with one hand on the trigger
and a hand in the cookie jar

dude, dude, dude
you won’t get far with that attitude

we could learn to like
real life as an afterthought
though blue suburban skies
were painted on our hearts

and maybe we could be
even happier than we were told
and at very least
we can say it was our own

born between the lines
in the pages of a storybook
believing we could fly
before we ever learned to walk

I'm just trying to get off the ground
looking up cos it's a long way down

---
let the sky cry all our tears
trying to dodge the rain


---

way

born into a crazy time
safe inside our mind's four walls
half the world's just getting by
but we always wanted more

but they stole that plan
right out of our hands
so we’re taking it back

yeah we’re taking it back
we’re taking it back
yeah we’re taking it back
we’re taking it back

crossing the divide
to the world that's right front of us
where we could always look
but we could never touch

and they built that life for us
now we’re taking it back

[chorus]

and I know that I've been living with some ghosts
but it's time to let them go
and we can keep the life they stole
cos we’re taking it back…

[chorus/outro]

---
and at very least
 we could call it our own
 born into a grave
 safe inside our own four walls

 i've been cryin to the sky
 tell me why
 there's no sunshine today
 I've been cryin to the sky
 I can't hide
 the tears that fall like rain



and my hands start shaking, my heart starts racing
and I'm praying we can figure this out
cos I can't stand living with a clock that's ticking
when the only time is now
no one needs our innocence
you live on the wind to be buried in the ground
at least we'll say we took the long way down

but I want to feel you so I know that you're real

---
and they made our plans, so we're making them back

one road came and another went
followed it in circles til I was spent
until I finally found the place that I had left

and I was right back where I started from (he swam the oceans, uh wo-oh oh)
right back where I started from (he roamed the deserts, uh wo-oh oh oh)
right back where I started from
now I'm just waiting for the end to come

all the roads lead to one
and rode off to the setting sun
and when I end up there then I’m gonna end up gone

[chorus]

lost in the weeds since the day I was born
blazing a lonesome trail through the world
now any old place I stay I can call my home

[chorus]

---

followed the road down to the [bitter] end
running in circles til I was spent
and I finally came round to the place I had left

now I'm right back where I started from (he swam the oceans, uh wo-oh oh)
right back where I started from (he roamed the deserts, uh wo-oh oh oh)
right back where I started from
someone wake me up when the end is come

kicking up dust since the day I was born
blazing a lonesome trail through the world
well any old place I stay might as well be home

cos I'm right back where I started from (he swam the oceans, uh wo-oh oh)
right back where I started from (he roamed the deserts, uh wo-oh oh oh)
right back where I started from
someone wake me up when the end is come

I'm going crazy
this world is wearing me down
I'm going crazy
waiting on a line for the line
that's how it feels
when you're chasing your tail
til the end of time

well ashes for ashes and dust for your dust
a million times more won't add up to much
cos when it's over it ain't over til you give back the torch [put out the torch]

and you'll be right back where I started from (he swam the oceans, uh wo-oh oh)
right back where you started from (he roamed the deserts, uh wo-oh oh oh)
right back where you started from
someone wake us up when the end has come

---

[when it's over it's over done and it's as good as gone]
[when it's over it's over and they ain't keeping score]
[cos any way you count it I ain't the lucky one]


---

strapped to a rolling stone
that's how it feels
when you're spinnin your wheels
[[all the way to kingdom come]] [ground]


[walkin up the down hill]
[til the end of your days]
]

must, lust, such, much

prayer for the gods and a slap in the face


all the roads lead to one
and rode off to the setting sun
and when I end up there then I’m gonna end up gone


---
when I was hoping that the end had come

one road straight the other bent
following the path other had lead
and I looked around

---
[from: still haven’t found]

and I rolled into town in a ’97 jetta
doors were shaking and my foot stuck to the pedal
I’ve been trying to make my way to mrs. make-it-alright
looks like another two-bit saturday night (alright)
it's just another two-bit saturday night

---


hey buddy I could drown in my beer
if I weren’t here talking to you
saw a sight from the corner of my eye
but she dissappeared too soon
[so many beauties walking in the door but they're only passing through]

so lend me your ear and I’ll sing you a song
of a man always out of key
cos I’ve been looking near and far for my queen of hearts
but she isn’t looking for me

rolled into town in a ’97 jetta
doors were shaking and my foot stuck to the pedal
I’m just trying to make my way to mrs. make-it-right

looks like another two-bit saturday night
just another two-bit saturday night

---

so babe would you give me two more chances
to prove my love to you
cos I tried to make a deal with the devil
but the devil didn’t come through

---
roll into the city in a 97 jetta
flying through the red lights holding down the pedal
just trying to find me a mrs. make-it-alright
[just trying to make it to mrs. make-it-alright]
[just trying to catch up to mrs. make-it-alirhgt]
looks like it’s gonna be...

---
looking everywhere for mrs. make-it-alright


things are looking up but they ain’t getting better
found the words but nothing comes out right
just another...

[A D G E]

---
we drank em under the table
and fell asleep on the floor
we were ready willing and able
but they showed us the door

cos there ain’t nothing else to do around here
but sling back your whiskey and hope for the best

I said it's not over til it's over
she said we've already crossed that line
I can't tell one feeling from another
she said it's alright, could we just be here in this moment tonight?

so I'll jump on into the ocean
and I'll kiss the shore one more time
and ride this wave to the other side
ride this wave to the other side

take a trip with me into the world we left behind
see all the ways we could have lived that life
my plans and my dreams were just sand in your lust machine
and you never paid them any mind

[chorus]

cos we're not the lucky ones who get to feel this way
for the rest of our lives
we'd better use this all up right here and now
before we say goodbye
goodbye... [x3]

[chorus x2]

gotta find a way out of this town
been sinking so fast I’m already underground
one foot in the mud
the other's running away

got a mind to throw it all away
can’t leave the stable without burning some hay hay hay
gonna set a fire
one place or another now
(and everybody knows)

I ain’t a lucky one
seventh son of a seventh son
gotta take whatever comes my way

so I ain't waiting (nah nah)
for the clouds to break apart
I ain't waiting (nah nah)
for a light to shine through the dark
the train leaves today
can’t let it get away
I ain't waiting for a better day

I ain’t waiting (nah nah)
for the red sea to part
I ain’t waiting (nah nah)
for the orchestra to start
got plans for today
ain’t wasting my time praying
I ain't waiting for a better day

picked my soul up at the lost and found
been searching so hard my eyes burnt a hole in the ground
I'm tired of looking for things I can't see anyway

---

been up and down these streets
my heart cupped in my hands
from the left coast to the right coast
looking for the promised land
but twelve years of hell is all that I could stand


---

sometimes it’s a long way down
and there’s no easy way around it
time to saddle up the horse
and get back on it, make that jump
cos the only way over is up


==
sometimes it’s a long way down
and there’s no easy way around it
time to saddle up the horse
and get back on it
sometimes the only way out is up


---
gotta mind to throw it all away
gonna run so fast that I’m bound to find a way
out of here
one way or another
gonna pave the road with tears

we been longing so long
there’s nothing left to long for


[CH]

===
i got plans for the rain
i won't waste them away

i’m six feet underground

so I wear my fire like a tattoo
cos I've been burned so many times
there's nothing [skin] to go back to

but I wear this desire like tattoo
left home so long ago
there's nothing to go back to

and it's time to take the devil down
time to take the devil down
time to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground [x2]


---
[been scarred so many times, there's no skin to go back to]

it's taking me over
I'm shaking all over

I'm ready to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground
I'm ready to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground

---

rage in my veins
can't sit still, run away
looking round the room
crazy eyes, poker face
and I feel it heating up, working up a sweat
boiling over, cutting through
here again, on a razor's edge

it's taking me over
I'm shaking all over

I'm ready to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground
I'm ready to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground

ticking clock, shaking bomb
sending us to kingdom come
going off, as we run
time is now, on the mark

---
they don't have a piece of mind to give
they're gonna give it anyway
they don't have a better life to live
they're gonna live it anyway

they don't want it if it's gonna be hard
they're gonna try to take it from me
they don't want it if they have to change their part
they're gonna try to make me do it

but I wear this desire like tattoo
left home so long ago
there's nothing to go back to

and it's time to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground
time to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground


---

[emot: agitation]

can't sit still
running fingers through my hair
sweat on my forehead
flush face
poker eyes / crazy eyes / cocaine eyes
looking round
double down
pacing the floor, back and forth
words come stammering out
flinching, razor's edge, on edge
unbutton shirt
heating up, boiling over, running hot
steam rising, blood boiling
don't want to be like this, get a grip / losing my grip
running for the exits / looking for the exit (sign)
papers scattered on the floor
ticking clock / ticking time bomb, ready to go off, like a bomb, sending us to kingdom come

I'm ready to take the devil down
idea: ready to fight, find the emotional energy inside me to get this done


stupid people are trying to hold me back
but I can't stop now

people who are attached to comfort are trying to hold me back
but I can't stop now

cos I put so much into this
I've got no life to go back to



now people challenged by my success want to fight even harder
but it's not their turn

it's my turn

so I'm gonna take the devil down

it rumbles [it's shaking all over]
it builds [it's rising up]
it boils over [it's taking me over]
it's out of control [you [I] can't make it stop]

I'm gonna take the devil down

it's my chance to do something for the world
so I'm gonna take the devil down

so I'm gonna take the devil down!

and I refuse to be a fool for a fool
and I won't beg to be a pawn in a game
that somehow we're both gonna lose
yeah we know we're both gonna lose


---

drowned in my tears too many times now

swallowed your pride too many times now

cos I’d rather be a fool for a fool
than to live my life without you

I got a boat
out here on the diamond sea
just trying to stay afloat
looking for good company
and while I’ve been praying
that the end’s in sight
all my friends been saying
hey man it's gonna be alright

I got a note
that’s searching for a melody
I keep a little hope
it’s gonna find somebody
cos everybody’s trying
to find a pod for their pea
and everybody's eyein'
that same palm tree

cast aways out on the sea
you and me are headed for the same palm tree
cast aways out on the sea
you and me are headed for the same palm tree

---
underneath that same palm tree
[sailing through the diamond sea]

palm tree
palm tree
we’re all headed for the same palm tree

I got a lock
waiting for a golden key
I’m selling all my stock
and packing up the company

alone and alive I said
and pulling through
I learned to like the sleepless nights
I waited up for you

but no angels came upon me
no visions in the night
I prayed until my hands caught fire
I cursed the candle light

and I cried all I’m listening for
is a love song drifting from an open door

save me a place in your heart
make me a joyful sound
lay me down in your arms
and I will call it hallowed ground

---

alone and alive we said
just passing through
we learned to like the sleepless nights
we learned to live the homeless life
we learned to start over again
and make the same things new

and I'll keep on listening for
a love song drifting from an open door

save me a place in your heart
make me a joyful sound
lay me down in your arms
and I will call it hallowed ground


---
make a place to belong
play me a joyful sound
lay me down in your arms

make me a place in your heart
give me a world where I belong




take me where I belong
tear all your fences down [let all the walls fall down]
wake me into a new world
and I’ll call it hallowed ground

take me where I belong
tear all your fences down
wake me into your arms
and I will call it hallowed ground

---

show me an end to this road
paint me a sky of blue [let all your walls fall down]
give me a place to call home
and I will call it hallowed ground


make me a home in your arms
play me a joyful sound
save me a place in your heart
and I'll call it hallowed ground


living through the dark days
riding on a bad wave
this bomb is ready to blow
and they're lining up my ride to the other side
but I ain't ready to go

...

...

I got a feeling
the sun is coming back again
I got a feeling
this day is never gonna end
I got a feeling
we're gonna be alright
we're gonna live in the light

---

...
and I'm trying every way
to make it through the day
with my feet on the ground
and the time has finally come
but I can't see the sun
with my head in the clouds

(pc)
and when the new day is finally in sight
I'm gonna stand high, throw my
two hands up into the sky

with my head up in the clouds
and my feet stuck in the ground
sometimes I can't seem to move [I'm just standing still; standing around]

but I hear ...

and I tried the spiritual and the miracle cure
but that only works on the sincere and the pure


miracle cure
bell curve
mackarel
literature





one foot on the track
and one foot on the ground
they're tired of running away
head's up in the clouds
but I'll be coming down
soon as I find my way


cos I got one hand on the trigger
and two feet in the ...
I got my head in the clouds

but ...
and I ain't coming down
til I shed off this frown

gonna throw my hands to the sky


and I'm trying to ignore
the fire [sirens; wolves; world] outside my door
cos I ain't ready to go
[cos I don't wanna know]

cos it's one foot in the real world
one foot sinking deeper
into a mountain of ...


[sequel; seagull; steeple; people; deep hole]

real world; dream girl; steam roll;
world;


I'm stuck inside a bad dream [nightmare]

cos it's one foot in the fire
the other in the pan
your head is

cos I got a few more things left in
my bucket list of dreams and
it's kinda hard to let go

[tragic; magic]

to do before I'm all set (before I lose it)

===

and it's too hard to ignore
when it's knocking

and I'm trying to ignore it
cos the real world's at my door but
I ain't ready to go

tried to stop the war
cos they're knocking on my door
but I ain't ready to go


and I tried to fall in line
and I tried to tune it out
make it stop

and I told 'em all to stop it
and I tried to make it stop



but real life is knocking
I ain't ready to go


===

and they're lining up my ride to the other side
but ain't ready to go
cos I'm already all in
when I hear that trumpet calling
I'm coming down from the hills

you you you make me feel everything more


you you you lift the clouds, and clear up the fog [cut through the fog]
you you you make me see a world with my heart
you you you let me be everything that I want
you make me feel everything more
you make me feel everything more
you make me feel everything

---
when I got clouds to chase away
when I got endless days of rain
you're there when I need ya

and when I'm too high up in the sky
when I got lightning in my eyes
I know that you feel it

cos sometimes it takes a lot
to put away your broken heart
and take a little step out your front door

---

but sometimes it takes a lot
to take a broken heart
and throw it out into the wind

to open up your heart
to see all that the world has got to give


and you make make me feel everything more
you make make me feel everything more
you make make me feel everything everything more
(you make make me feel everything more)
(you make make me feel everything)

you show me a world I can only see with my heart
you make me feel everything more

you make me feel everything more
you lift the clouds, you clear the fog
you show me a world I can only see with my heart
you make me feel everything more

you make me see things with my heart
you make me feel the beat of my heart
you make me see the light shine through the fog [dark]
you paint the colors on a cloudy sky


clouds
fog
glasses
pastel
lift
air
dark
day
vision
clear
eyes

show
out
breathe, beat, see, feel

[when the sun is shining I’m burning up (mm hm)
jumping in a lake or drowning in a paper cup (oh yeah)]
and when I’m down I’m under the ground
then I hit rock bottom and bounce
and I end up right back at the top (oh yeah because)

you make me feel uh huh everything more
you make me feel uh huh everything more
you make me feel uh huh everything everything more

gonna hop a rocket and fly away (hey hey)
ain’t gonna find me shooting for the stars halfway (mm hm)
cos when I’m high I'm good as it comes
and when I’m low there’s nowhere but up
and I don't paint my sky in shades of gray (hey hey it’s just that)
[and I can't see a single shade of gray]

[chorus/instr]

I don’t need those pixie dust dreams
I found my muse in a human being
I’m feeling feelings I never felt before (hey hey it’s just cos)

[chorus/outro]

I got the hots and I’m sweating bullets

been chasing memories around
let em loose and run em down
been seeing ghosts of you
I got an empty room with a better view
I kept my head afloat
found the raft, sank the boat
and finally I'm fading out of blue

---
[from pretty noose]

I kept the bigger half
sank the boat, kept the raft

I'm coming back
falling down from cloud nine
cutting through the line
gonna find my way to you
oh oh back to you

it's been too long
waiting out the storm
twiddilin my thumbs
wondering what wrong
oh oh I lost my mind

give it all I got
tell me whatcha want
I can make it real
gimme just a shot (uh oh)
at your big time, big time, big time, big time

give it all I got
tell me whatcha want
I can make it real
gimme just a shot (uh oh)
at your big time, big time, big time, big time

big time (uh oh oh)
big time (uh oh oh)
big time (uh oh oh)
big time

and everybody's telling me
the best things in life are free

if you're headed for a strike-out
on a saturday night out
looking for your real friends
to drown out that feeling
call it a night, wait for the light
and c'mon down to the old bar
little coffee and jack
we'll be knockin' 'em back
with the sunday morning all-stars


He fell on rain
Swam through rivers
And found a way to her heart

She sailed on waves
Through oceans and winters
And nothing could keep them apart

But autumn whispered
Their names on the breeze
And painted their leaves
faded and withered

And they came down
With the change of the season
Ended up being
Right back at the start

So he fell on rain
Swam through rivers
And found a way to her heart

valentines day
I bought a rose for someone
a thousand miles away
and I thought about the times we spent
before she got married
as I put it in a vase

it's been so long
holding on to hope in vain
waiting for this long forgotten love
but I'm just
adding up the yesterdays
for us I know
tomorrow never comes

back in the valley again
wondering how low I can get
driving down highways
of strip malls and heartaches
to end up where I began
right here back in the valley again



---

but it's too late for holding
on to these old dreams
I'm stuck in the valley again
driving down highways
of strip malls and heartaches
and wondering if this road
is ever gonna end



---

It’s too late for me now
to make my own way out
I’m stuck in the valley again
driving down highways of
strip malls and heartaches
and wondering where this road ends
and when the next life begins

you don't need say goodbye
if you wanna go
I ain't putting up a fight
I don't even need to know
and you don't gotta to waste your time
talking to an empty room
you just gotta realize
that baby I'm as gone as you



---

love me or leave
or make me believe
we're going somewhere fast
'cause I won't give you my whole life
if you won't give it back
how can you have one more chance
if you didn't want the first
[I ain't down for waiting it out]
if we can't make this work, then baby...

you don't need say goodbye
if you wanna go
I ain't putting up a fight
I'm already out the door
and you don't need to waste your time
talking to an empty room
you just gotta realize
that baby I'm as gone as you

---



do it when the time is right
I don't even need to know
you don't need to waste your time
talking to an empty room
'cause baby when you say goodbye
I'll be gone as you

'cause if it's done then it's done
stick a fork in it
I don't need a novel
just for calling it quits
you don't need to say goodbye
to an empty room
baby I'll be gone as you

left the great out there behind
ten years was  a long goodbye
made myself a beeline for the old town
just another world that I
lost myself trying to find
something I thought I'd find by now

but everything real comes back somehow
ooh ooh

so much for up and on
I’m coming back to that good old place
right where I started from
I found a home where I can lay
this old hat down
I’m putting it back on solid ground


---

[i'm a fire]

everywhere I look I find
same story different time
everybody trying to fill the void [went, sent, get]
but now I'm headed back to see
same town different me
I don't need a miracle just yet
'cause everything that's real never left

in how many worlds must I
lose myself so I can find
something I thought I’d find by now

I don’t know when I got to go
throw me back out into the world
I don’t know if you know what you do to me
it don’t matter baby

and I don't know if you feed me lines
I don’t care if I'm wasting time
all I know is I know what I need's
right in front of me

you're my sugar pill
you're my candy lovin'
you're my two of these
and babe I'll call you in the morning

maybe it was an angel
that flew on down that day
gave your hand to me
took my heart away

'cause how'd you know it was just in time
or how many nights I prayed
to make this all worthwhile
to live to see a better day

now I won't give up when the time's get tough
I only want you to stay

love won't keep us together
love won't tear us apart
love is not here forever
love is only a start

let it rain let it rain
fill the empty space
let it pour let it pour
wash away my sad face
and a lifetime of the pain that came before

let it rain let it rain
from the water bring new birth
let it pour let it pour
wash away this scorched earth
and a million sad refrains we sang before

where loneliness and harmony collide
meet me there and help me fill the void

let it rain let it rain
let the sky cry all our tears
let it pour let it pour
wash away these lost years
and may your heart find all the hope it knew before



I don’t know what happened to you
you got burned by the fire you walked into
and I watched from the comfort of my misery
I always thought that my pain would set me free

and I don’t know what became of us
we always knew that this road was dangerous
but we kept walking til we wore out our feet
and ended up somewhere we didn’t want to be

now you can chase love out to hell and back
lift up the train and put it right back on the track
but the good life stitched together falls apart at the seams
and you and me are just pieces of the broken dream
you and me, we’re just pieces of the broken dream

I don’t know if the thrill is over yet
I’ve been waiting for the day that I’ll forget
putting that life six feet underground
it’s high time that I burned my bridges down


---
things are so different here now that you’re gone
I’ve been flirting with the thought of moving on

step by step down the road of time
I’ve been waiting for a dime

I always thought that fate would rescue me

and I don’t know if it could have come to more
I always wondered what hell had in store

I didn’t know what got into you

you were so hard to see

woke up this morning with a dream stuck in my head
couldn’t make it go away
the shining hope of my world again
appears out of a foggy mirror

just one more day
in perpetual motion
trying to catch up
with the last one who got away
so today I’m gonna jump into a brand new ocean
and try to find a better way
to the other side

until the moon falls out of the sky
and lands right at my feet
I’m gonna keep on chasing these beautiful lies
because it makes my life complete

we were living in an afterthought
blue suburban skies
pixelated hearts

and we were chasing empty ghosts
soap bubble airplanes
keeping us afloat

now we’re the downcast on our way up
catching rain in a paper cup
we might as well have settled for half full

---




now real life is an afterthought
blue suburban skies
pixelated hearts

and they of perpetual rewind
handed us the keys
to the kingdom of the blind

now we’re the downcast on our way up (oh oh oh)
catching rain in a paper cup (oh oh oh)
we never thought to settle for half full
so we’re going digital

we’re making love bit by bit (going digital)
we built our whole world on it (going digital)
they sold the dream then broke our hearts (going digital)
we'll find the soul that the real world stole from us



---
[v]
two hearts in perpetual motion

we were handed down the keys
to a kingdom of the blind

they gave us the keys
unlocked a door to nowhere

pixelated sky

love is big
and wild and free
and ours got lost
in the endless sea

but we swam back
for one more try
to make one night
last all our lives

now we’ve been shakin the ceiling
while the neighbors are sleeping
tryin move heaven and earth
tonight we'll dive off the deep end
tryin to find that old feeling
giving love its moneys worth

life is short
and gone too soon
and we're just ghosts
on our way through

trying find a moment
to hold onto
and find the spirit
that we can move
... is a funny thing
it can make the angels sing
love is lost but when it's found
it can make the world go round
living in each other's light
we can make it last forever tonight

she's got the motor on
got the radio blasting my song
but this moment won't last long
here one day the next one she'll be gone

she's got the sails up high
got the stars set in her sights
and the sky's so clear tonight
she can see straight through to another life

'cos she's too cool for me
someday I'll see her on the cover of a magazine
I'm just another boy who needs a girl
and she is only passing through my little world

she's got the devil by her side
and the angels holding on for dear life
and if you take her up on the ride
don’t expect to make it out alive

she’s got the world at her beck and call
they’re lining up straight out the door
and if I try to break up this fall
I’m only gonna fall a little more

[chorus]

---
She'll make you roll the dice
And if the numbers come out right

She got the magic carpet ride
 But if you play the cards just right
 You could steal a little piece of heaven tonight

 she’s got the world on a string


she’s got the wind at her back
she’s got the training jumping off the track

cut you some slack
everything you lack
she’s got the knick and she’s got the knack
heart attack



she's got everything I need
she's got the will and she’s got the means
she walks the talk and does the deeds

… whacks the weeds


... she got the wind at her back
... she got the sails up high
... headlights
... down to the last drop
... don't stand a chance

sky is clear tonight
but the sky's so clear tonight, you can see... [the break of dawn]
but the sky's so clear tonight, she can see another life
sitting by my side
take flight
want her by my side
moon rise
highway's shining in her headlights


who'll wear your boots when you are gone
 who'll yodelay your cowgirl song
 who'll roll in the hay
 and let you ride the horse all day
 tell me who'll wear your boots when you are gone

who'll fill the pantry when you leave
who'll stir the pot and cook the beans
who'll wind up your clock
and put the key into your lock
tell me who'll fill the pantry when you leave

you're always 1, 2, 3 steps from the door
you're always gettin' in then you're gettin' out
then you're gettin' back for more

but tell me who'll wear your boots
who'll wear your boots
who'll wear your boots
when you are gone

---

who'll fill your pantry when i'm gone
who'll cook the beans and pop the corn

ten years making my way out of a paper bag
to find the world's just same as I left it
now the bad's still bad but the good ain't better
you can change yourself
but that don't change the weather

well she wasn't the one or the one that got away
I was the one wondering why anyone would
stay in bed sleeping in forever
so I ran down the dream
but that didn't change the weather

it seems this storm front came in before the last one was gone
and the clouds are all clearing up but I can't see the
sun shinin' through where they said it'd get better
cos you can dodge the rain drops
but that don't change the weather

funny feelings sneaking up inside of me
calling out through my stomach walls
sayin this girl could chew you up and spit you out
and never even know

but it's heads-down hands-up hail-mary
can you break my lonely fall
cos I threw the Rockwell out the window
a long long time ago
a long long long long time ago

and now the ribbons are falling out of the sky [uh uh oh?]
and cupid's angels are packing it up
I could feel this way for the rest of my life
but even that wouldn't be enough [extra 2-4 beats bass/guitar double lick over break?]

I've been taken over by a strange fascination
like I'm 8-years old again
and there's nowhere to turn but my own imagination
cos I've fallen in love with a lesbian

---

she got her voodoo spell hanging over me
magnets pointed at my heart
she got the angel's smile and the devil's eye



marching me to the beat of her second-line [drummer]
making circles round her heart
forever circling around her heart

[breakdown section x2 after verse 2, second-line beat, then intro guitar solo chords & then back to chorus]
cos I'm lovestruck again
I'm lovestruck again
and I never wanted it to be this way
but I gotta take it where I can
[but I'm gonna get it where I can]

knocking on my stomach door

chorus 2: cos no love no pain can break this spell, when...

funny feelings sneaking up inside of me
calling me through my stomach walls
saying this girl will chew you up and spit you out
and she'll never even know

but there’s nothing I can do or say now
to break my lonely fall
when self control jumped out the window
a long long time ago
a long long long long time ago

and now they've taken all the ribbons down from the sky
and cupid's angels are packing it up
and it don’t matter if I laugh shout or cry
it’s never gonna be enough

I've been taken over by this strange fascination
like I'm 8 years old again
but there's nothing there 'cept your own imagination

funny feelings sneaking up inside of me
calling out through my stomach walls
sayin don't let that girl blow down your house of cards
you've got to keep your control

...


got some funny feelings sneaking up inside me
calling through my stomach walls
and my house of cards is tumbling down
cos I've lost my self control

she's got a way of standing on the chimney
as your house burns down
and when she smiles at me basking in the glory
I only want her more



she's got the stars in her eyes
...
and I want to hold her tonight
worse than anything I've ever felt

and she might think it's a joke
...
but I want to hold her like a kitten
and treat her the like queen bee

sometimes I want to hold her
and have her spend the night
and sometimes when the feeling takes over
I'm afraid that I will try

turns me on in ways I never knew I could be turned on
makes me question things I thought I knew

and anywhere this crazy life goes
I want her here with me
to hold her like a kitten
love her like a sister
and treat her like a queen bee

makes me see the possibility of who I could be
something I never dreamed
don't know what to do with myself with my love
strange love, bubbling up
didn't know I was supposed to feel that, but always had the intuition

the ribbons are falling right out of the sky
and cupid's angels are packing it in
'cause no love no pain will make you whole again
when you've fallen in love with a lesbian

now they're taking down the ribbons down from the sky
and cupid's angels are packing it in
all the tunnels have shut off their light

---

funny feelings sneaking up inside of me
calling out through my stomach walls
taking over my daydreams
watching my house of cards fall

but there’s nothing I can do or say now
to save a broken heart
cos it’s a one way dead end road

I tried to stay under the table and mind my own
I tried to say that I could make this cave my home
but the world didn't stop turning for my pride
I had to fake it til I made it to the other side

it's not a crying feeling
this breaking of my heart
cos part of me knew how it'd end
right from the start
and I went blind but now I see
that our grace became our fall
and that's not a crying feeling
just a wake up call

---

we liked to say the beaten path wasn’t for us
and together we made our way through the wilderness
but we always had our star
our little light shining afar
and we always had the comfort of each other’s arms

and today all the stars have gone away

---
 we used to make our way together through the wilderness
just two happy soldiers of the light of love

johnny blue jeans is living undercover
handed his dreams to the working week
got a masters degree in something or another
and living on paper is harder than it seems

but that road leads to nowhere in the end
everything good is still out there waiting
you're spending all your karma on fair-weather friends
and finding that there's no one left to repay it

cos now they're on you like a hound
but when you need em they won't be around
so if you're gonna get outta town
gotta burn some bridges down

like you'll never be back
burn some bridges down
you're on a one-way track
burn some bridges down
there's no reason to get comfortable
cos it's time to set fire to your little world

benny the jet is a good friend of mine
seems like forever but nobody's counting
he left a message for me said he's doing just fine
and ran away to a life in the country

but that'll only get you so far away
everything you have is right here waiting
you're gonna have to come back to the city someday
they'll catch you lying flat on the pavement

and what did it get you anyhow?
everything bad comes back around
so take a tip if you wanna get outta town
time to burn some bridges down

I know I’ve been getting kind of  shy
sitting on these words of mine
trying to work in a line
edgewise with you

I know they’re knockin at your door
and the games they play can be such a bore
and everything you get is more
than you bargained for

so whatever gets ya in the groove
whatever makes ya wanna move
whatever gets ya feeling high high high high high
is what I wanna do to you

that’s what I wanna do… to you [x2]

you held the hoops and I jumped through the fire
now I look stupid and you look inspired
how did I wind up singing for your personal choir?
well I’m tired

you walked on water, I laid down the cape (hey hey hey)
you climbed the mountains while I ran the rat race
somehow my face wound up on a banana peel [engraved?]
so next time here’s the deal...

I ain’t doing your rain dance
uh no oh, ay ay ay
ain’t doing your rain dance
uh no oh, ay ay ay
ain’t doing your rain dance
uh no oh, ay ay I ain’t doing that dance
no I ain’t doing that dance

you took manhattan
I took the beads
I took staten island
and you’re taking queens

staring at the tv, 24 hours of nothing much
emptiness inside me been reaching out to feel your touch
and the days and weeks have passed
so fast since we’ve been apart
now I want you to be here again
bringing up the morning in my arms

I know I said it first
and I meant it, every word
but this feeling came from the blue
and I know we said goodbye
and I’ve had my chance to cry
but I need you
next to me tonight

breathing in and out and in
anything to calm my mind
cruel world’s been closing in
I can’t be alone for the rest of time
maybe I just want to know you’re lonely without me
it’s such a selfish kind of love
that I need

and I know I left you first
and I meant it, every word
but I need you in my arms tonight
and I know we said goodbye
and I’ve had my chance to cry
but I need you in my arms tonight

it’s such a selfish kind of love that we need

and I know how much it hurt

been chasing memories around
let em loose and run em down
been seeing ghosts of you
I got an empty room with a better view
I kept my head afloat
found the raft, sank the boat
and finally I'm fading out of blue

---
[from pretty noose]

I kept the bigger half
sank the boat, kept the raft

you you you make me feel everything more


you you you lift the clouds, and clear up the fog [cut through the fog]
you you you make me see a world with my heart
you you you let me be everything that I want
you make me feel everything more
you make me feel everything more
you make me feel everything

---
when I got clouds to chase away
when I got endless days of rain
you're there when I need ya

and when I'm too high up in the sky
when I got lightning in my eyes
I know that you feel it

cos sometimes it takes a lot
to put away your broken heart
and take a little step out your front door

---

but sometimes it takes a lot
to take a broken heart
and throw it out into the wind

to open up your heart
to see all that the world has got to give


and you make make me feel everything more
you make make me feel everything more
you make make me feel everything everything more
(you make make me feel everything more)
(you make make me feel everything)

C Em7 Dm7 Am7 G


you show me a world I can only see with my heart
you make me feel everything more

you make me feel everything more
you lift the clouds, you clear the fog
you show me a world I can only see with my heart
you make me feel everything more

you make me see things with my heart
you make me feel the beat of my heart
you make me see the light shine through the fog [dark]
you paint the colors on a cloudy sky

[when the sun is shining I’m burning up (mm hm)
jumping in a lake or drowning in a paper cup (oh yeah)]
and when I’m down I’m under the ground
then I hit rock bottom and bounce
and I end up right back at the top (oh yeah because)

you make me feel uh huh everything more
you make me feel uh huh everything more
you make me feel uh huh everything everything more

gonna hop a rocket and fly away (hey hey)
ain’t gonna find me shooting for the stars halfway (mm hm)
cos when I’m high I'm good as it comes
and when I’m low there’s nowhere but up
and I don't paint my sky in shades of gray (hey hey it’s just that)
[and I can't see a single shade of gray]

[chorus/instr]

I don’t need those pixie dust dreams
I found my muse in a human being
I’m feeling feelings I never felt before (hey hey it’s just cos)

[chorus/outro]

living through the dark days
riding on a bad wave
this bomb is ready to blow
and they're lining up my ride to the other side
but I ain't ready to go

...

...

I got a feeling
the sun is coming back again
I got a feeling
this day is never gonna end
I got a feeling
we're gonna be alright
we're gonna live in the light

---

...
and I'm trying every way
to make it through the day
with my feet on the ground
and the time has finally come
but I can't see the sun
with my head in the clouds

(pc)
and when the new day is finally in sight
I'm gonna stand high, throw my
two hands up into the sky

with my head up in the clouds
and my feet stuck in the ground
sometimes I can't seem to move [I'm just standing still; standing around]

but I hear ...

and I tried the spiritual and the miracle cure
but that only works on the sincere and the pure


miracle cure
bell curve
mackarel
literature





one foot on the track
and one foot on the ground
they're tired of running away
head's up in the clouds
but I'll be coming down
soon as I find my way


cos I got one hand on the trigger
and two feet in the ...
I got my head in the clouds

but ...
and I ain't coming down
til I shed off this frown

gonna throw my hands to the sky


and I'm trying to ignore
the fire [sirens; wolves; world] outside my door
cos I ain't ready to go
[cos I don't wanna know]

cos it's one foot in the real world
one foot sinking deeper
into a mountain of ...


[sequel; seagull; steeple; people; deep hole]

real world; dream girl; steam roll;
world;


I'm stuck inside a bad dream [nightmare]

cos it's one foot in the fire
the other in the pan
your head is

cos I got a few more things left in
my bucket list of dreams and
it's kinda hard to let go

[tragic; magic]

to do before I'm all set (before I lose it)

===

and it's too hard to ignore
when it's knocking

and I'm trying to ignore it
cos the real world's at my door but
I ain't ready to go

tried to stop the war
cos they're knocking on my door
but I ain't ready to go


and I tried to fall in line
and I tried to tune it out
make it stop

and I told 'em all to stop it
and I tried to make it stop



but real life is knocking
I ain't ready to go


===

and they're lining up my ride to the other side
but ain't ready to go
cos I'm already all in
when I hear that trumpet calling
I'm coming down from the hills

alone and alive I said
and pulling through
I learned to like the sleepless nights
I waited up for you

but no angels came upon me
no visions in the night
I prayed until my hands caught fire
I cursed the candle light

and I cried all I’m listening for
is a love song drifting from an open door

save me a place in your heart
make me a joyful sound
lay me down in your arms
and I will call it hallowed ground

---

alone and alive we said
just passing through
we learned to like the sleepless nights
we learned to live the homeless life
we learned to start over again
and make the same things new

and I'll keep on listening for
a love song drifting from an open door

save me a place in your heart
make me a joyful sound
lay me down in your arms
and I will call it hallowed ground


---
make a place to belong
play me a joyful sound
lay me down in your arms

make me a place in your heart
give me a world where I belong




take me where I belong
tear all your fences down [let all the walls fall down]
wake me into a new world
and I’ll call it hallowed ground

take me where I belong
tear all your fences down
wake me into your arms
and I will call it hallowed ground

---

show me an end to this road
paint me a sky of blue [let all your walls fall down]
give me a place to call home
and I will call it hallowed ground


make me a home in your arms
play me a joyful sound
save me a place in your heart
and I'll call it hallowed ground

I got a boat
out here on the diamond sea
just trying to stay afloat
looking for good company
and while I’ve been praying
that the end’s in sight
all my friends been saying
hey man it's gonna be alright

I got a note
that’s searching for a melody
I keep a little hope
it’s gonna find somebody
cos everybody’s trying
to find a pod for their pea
and everybody's eyein'
that same palm tree

cast aways out on the sea
you and me are headed for the same palm tree
cast aways out on the sea
you and me are headed for the same palm tree

---
underneath that same palm tree
[sailing through the diamond sea]

palm tree
palm tree
we’re all headed for the same palm tree

I got a lock
waiting for a golden key
I’m selling all my stock
and packing up the company

so I wear my fire like a tattoo
cos I've been burned so many times
there's nothing [skin] to go back to

but I wear this desire like tattoo
left home so long ago
there's nothing to go back to

and it's time to take the devil down
time to take the devil down
time to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground [x2]


---
[been scarred so many times, there's no skin to go back to]

it's taking me over
I'm shaking all over

I'm ready to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground
I'm ready to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground

---

rage in my veins
can't sit still, run away
looking round the room
crazy eyes, poker face
and I feel it heating up, working up a sweat
boiling over, cutting through
here again, on a razor's edge

it's taking me over
I'm shaking all over

I'm ready to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground
I'm ready to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground

ticking clock, shaking bomb
sending us to kingdom come
going off, as we run
time is now, on the mark

---
they don't have a piece of mind to give
they're gonna give it anyway
they don't have a better life to live
they're gonna live it anyway

they don't want it if it's gonna be hard
they're gonna try to take it from me
they don't want it if they have to change their part
they're gonna try to make me do it

but I wear this desire like tattoo
left home so long ago
there's nothing to go back to

and it's time to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground
time to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground

gotta find a way out of this town
been sinking so fast I’m already underground
one foot in the mud
the other's running away

got a mind to throw it all away
can’t leave the stable without burning some hay hay hay
gonna set a fire
one place or another now
(and everybody knows)

I ain’t a lucky one
seventh son of a seventh son
gotta take whatever comes my way

so I ain't waiting (nah nah)
for the clouds to break apart
I ain't waiting (nah nah)
for a light to shine through the dark
the train leaves today
can’t let it get away
I ain't waiting for a better day

I ain’t waiting (nah nah)
for the red sea to part
I ain’t waiting (nah nah)
for the orchestra to start
got plans for today
ain’t wasting my time praying
I ain't waiting for a better day

picked my soul up at the lost and found
been searching so hard my eyes burnt a hole in the ground
I'm tired of looking for things I can't see anyway

---

been up and down these streets
my heart cupped in my hands
from the left coast to the right coast
looking for the promised land
but twelve years of hell is all that I could stand


---

sometimes it’s a long way down
and there’s no easy way around it
time to saddle up the horse
and get back on it, make that jump
cos the only way over is up


==
sometimes it’s a long way down
and there’s no easy way around it
time to saddle up the horse
and get back on it
sometimes the only way out is up


---
gotta mind to throw it all away
gonna run so fast that I’m bound to find a way
out of here
one way or another
gonna pave the road with tears

we been longing so long
there’s nothing left to long for

you can't put my ship in a bottle

I'm sitting on the highest cloud
lettin' my feet hang down babe and
watching the world go by
'cause you been hanging up all my moons
I'm just looking up at the view babe
and counting the stars in my eyes

---



and I'm
giving it all I got
giving it my best shot babe
ya hit me in the sweetest spot
and I'm
loving ya with all my heart
I knew right from the start babe
ya hit me in the sweetest spot



sitting on the highest cloud

loving you with all I got

and I'm
living in a teenage dream
feeling it in my bones babe
ya hit me in the sweetest spot


and I'm
taking it day by day
letting it all play out babe
and tryin not to fall apart
and I'm
letting the chips fall down
feeling it to my bones babe
ya hit me in the sweetest spot

I got no worries left for you
yesterday was yesterday
now tomorrow's coming through


but I got no worries anymore
ain't got one beat for you beating in my heart


I got no worries left for you
It's too late to care what you do
I'm over getting over
I'm in no hurry
to care about you 'cause I got no worries


I got no worries left for you
ain't got one beat of my heart that beats for you

I’ve given up on the ghost of you
Chasing down shadows
Running round in circles
Drowned in these blues
I’ve given up on the ghost of you
Gonna make it my own
Rihht in this moment
Breathe in the truth


I’ve been a prisoner of your love
Holding on to something I can’t have
My feet were stuck in the mud
Been all the way to hell and back

and I know we can come out on the other side

let's find our side of paradise
let's make a world of our own
let's get out beyond these city lights
somewhere the trains don't go

---

wherever we are
find our side of paradise
so we can get to the good part

radio radio silence
your eyes say all I need to hear
radio radio silence
your static's ringing in my ears

---

1 million nights on the road
missing our life waiting for your call

babe I'm coming home quick
I'm home sick for
the way that you kiss me
the way you move
a bottle of wine
and a sip of you
I'm homesick

baby tell me how long can we kiss goodbye
if you gonna break my heart don't do it twice
nothing we can do tonight is gonna save this love
we can keep on trying but the nick of time
ain't gonna come for us [ain't coming 'round for us]

Low and hurtin
The seas and all that stirs within them
My conscience stabbed with pain
Absolute zero
Up to my ankles in it
Headed in the right direction
One glass of beer one glass of wine


If we go up in smoke
If we go down in flames
Baby just hold me close
And remember my name

You’re the quiet one
You’re the wild one
You’re the party one
You’re the guarded one
You’re the one who gives
You’re the one who takes
You’re the one I dream of when I lay awake

'Cause you’ve got
multiple multiple
Personalities personalities
You and your
multiple multiple
Personalities personalities
And I like them all

Taking, laid back one, make it, getter done


Oil and water
Wine and cheese
Birds of a feather
Cream in your coffee
Cat/dog fight
Cats and dogs
Birds and the bees

===

So you found a smooth talker
With a silver tongue
Slapping backs and
Charming everyone
You can take him back
To meet mom and dad
...

Just a Prince Charming
With a fighting streak
Then he brings you flowers
And Gets down on his knees
And all your friends just roll their eyes
'Cause everybody sees

You’d go better with me



a little bit of loving’s a whole lotta nothing
a little bit of heartbreak knocking at your door
a little bit of you’s a ticket to the blues
‘cause I’m gonna need a whole lot more

[slow train feel?]


some things you thought would be around forever
you wake up one morning and they’re gone
some people change your life and never say good bye
but their memory will always carry on

we’ve got nothing but heaven tonight
I’m getting high as I wanna tonight
we’re starting fires in a world of ice
I’m gonna hit the highway/runway tonight
you shoulda come with a warning sign
I thought I told ya for the millionth time
we came a long way into the light
I wasn’t born with a broken heart
we might as well get higher than life
if you’re thinking like that then baby you thunk right
gotta a whole lotta nothin tonight
let me out of your doghouse tonight
we’re making some kind of magic tonight
all I want is that feeling again
got a long way to go tonight
I’m gonna feel this for the rest of my life
counting time to the beat of my heart

falling in love
crowds
the benediction
better than me
don’t look at me
give me that look
wasted time
come and get it
bastion of hope
better late than sorry
ground
in the night
home for good
we’ve got nothing
somewhere else
highway signs
best I got
light of today
what you’ve got
if nothing else
fire starters
cinderella
your memory
grand army plaza
settle for the night
better off tonight
you should have known
one line to draw
drawing lines
you go easy
I got it easy

jump on a train
take it out to the end of the line
leave the world we know
beyond this sea of lights
there’s gotta be something else
out on the other side

jump on a train
take it out to the edge of the world
in those hills of grass
where we can search for gold
there’s gotta be something else
out on the other side


I’ve been keeping my foot down on the gas
headed somewhere else and nowhere fast
hitching a ride out on the wind
to hell and back and back again

more or less [more is less; more is more]
saddle up and go
live for the fight
take the show on the road
take the show back home
part of the plan
heart of the problem
hot coal(s)
shotta love
one shot of love (and two shots of heartache)
one shot of love heartbreak back
givin’ it my best shot
cool to be cool and hot be hot
hit the ground runnin’ in the nick of time
dog days
double down
back on the case
back on the town
down with the cause
wasted time
if the one don’t get ya the other one will
how does it all go down
nothing that I wouldn’t say (to you; to your mama)


1. hard case of love
2. suddenly I can breathe a little easier
3. tomorrow will come
4. you wouldn't be the girl to follow me off the edge of the world
5. gonna paint by numbers 'til I make you mine
6. she's a double whammy
7. can I have a moment with you?
8. fool for a fool

---

it's poetry in motion
and emotion in the pure

Jack and diet coke

reverie
I still speak to you in dreams
you're always here
always part of me

memories
fade a little every time I breathe
you are the truth
that made me real

I’ll be the shoulder you lean on
I’ll be your soldier I’ll be your song


the joy
 the seed of doubt
 the bad luck
 the grief (and expression of) - blues
 the hope / the plan
 the musical power
 the negotiation
 the saving of a dark heart
 the escape
 the impulsive mistake
 the three loud noises
 the denial
 the new blues
 the vow
 the destruction
 the last cry

queen of hearts
queen of the underworld

 to the bottom of it

Take me back to the wishing well
Where everything
Was a penny and
A dream
you're just a fast talking, slow walking, two timing man

can't stay, can't go
can't play, can't fold
I'm outta luck

I'm going down with it
I'm gonna drown in it
just waiting 'round for the end to come
I'm going down with it
I'm gonna drown in it
got nothing now but a two-bit love


---


living in a silent scream
running backwards through your dreams
you gotta give everything you take

goodbye to new york city
hello to the skies of blue
whatever this long road has waiting for you
if you're going somewhere I'm going there too

it's time to let it go (pain, love, the past)
I want more than I'll ever have
it hurts to start over and over, but you always have hope
old time love
one day we'll make it
I still haven't found what I'm looking for
I want you so that I can be myself
why didn't I see what I had
let's drive off together


---

let's get away from this place
it's time to let that bird fly
I'll be a fool for a fool (if it helps me make it through this life)
I know you never let go, of the things you once had
it's time to let it all go
we got the world on a string
we got one day at a time
how can I a find a way back
why can't I find a way back
those days will never come back
I still got stars in my eyes
I'll never get where I'm going
I've seen the love in your eyes
one day we'll make it alright
I'm still trying to find
we got nothing but time
I got a lifetime to go
I know you're taking it slow
it's all a blur to me now
it's all a dream to me now
I hear the rhythm of love
we got the weight of the world, resting on our shoulders
show me the truth in your eyes (lies)

sounds good to me
let's call it a plan
just you and me
when it comes down to us
the old feeling
digging up feelings
skin and bones
ashes to ashes, love to love
your heart ain't in it

baby I'm an outbound soul
cos ya know that there's no one else
that can keep me hangin round here
cept for you
and baby I'm an outbound soul
cos ya know that there's no one else
that can bring a good man down
like the way you do
so I'm headed out

---


baby I'm just fog town bound
and ya know there ain't nowhere else
that can keep the sunshine out
when I need a little blue

and baby I'm just fog town bound
cos ya know there ain't no one else
that can bring a good man down
like the way you do

so I'm headed down
headed down to fog town

---


cos ya know there ain't no one round
here to bring a good man down
like the way you do

girl so I'm fog town bound

time will, move in, circles
time will wear us down
time will, crash in, to the shore
long after we are gone

but someday, when you throw my ashes to the sea
someday, when I'm riding on the wind
I'll live forever in this memory
I'll be back here with you again


---

someday I'll ride that wind
back here to be with you again
waiting for that moment

how come nothing's ever easy
I know I never asked for roses in my garden
but it's starting to feel like
the gods got something on me


no one showed up for the end of the world

we had meetings
 we had weddings
 we were washing our cats
 we were waiting to a-
 pply more makeup cos the
 we were ...
 friends were dying
 those jeans made us look fat
 we were waiting for the
 movie [and the website]


we had bills to pay


one day she was so sweet and kind
next day she had changed her mind
and here I am dazed and confused
never knew I had so much to lose

from the ashes to the rising
from the flames that turned to ice
from one end to the other she had me hooked
to the grave and from the cradle
with her angels and her devils
she knew how to burn me down with just one look

happy days are somewhere inside this life
I'm gonna find my way to the bottom of it
we don't wait for clouds to break
we don't ask the sun to shine
we already got it


you and me, we're keepin it cool
at the movies at the mall
crank the ac in the car
jump in the river like two foo-oo-ools
cos you and me, ooh ooh
we're keepin it cool ooh ooh
just keepin it cool ooh ooh
just  keepin it cool ooh ooh
we're just keepin it cool

---

and we'll be back for more
to soak up the sun
like two fools
we're keepin it cool


mama you can get high
you can get low
you can go anywhere you wanna go

baby stick with me
you're gonna see
it's just a matter of the birds and the bees

come together, no delaying
we gotta dance while the music's still playing (loud)
wanna hold you in my arms right now

we ain't got nothing on the birds and the bees

he fell on rain, found a way to her heart
 he traveled oceans, swam through puddles in the dark
 and it was all a world they'd never seen
 fits and starts and storyboards
 and panoramic dreams
 skies set on suns, moons rose from trees
 he fell to earth, one day from the blue

 take a picture of my face
 put in a frame
 put it on your nightstand
 let the time fly by
 from now until forever
 comes and goes
 then turn on the light
 and move on to the next life

 and let me stay here in your memories
 let me stay here in a moonlit scene
 let me stay here resting in your arms
 I will be here long after you're gone

so. close. running. scared.
 fly it down, let it go, cut it loose,
 let it come back to you.

 so. still. empty. air.
 breathe it in, let it go, take it back.
 it will be here again.

 what if we never close the circle
 what if we never make the sun shine
 like it did that day?
 we still can't tell if it was a dream
 if it was real, but who cares
 who knows
 it doesn't matter anymore.

so. far. horizons. fade.
let it rise, take the light, let it fall.
it will always be there.


I don't wanna talk it over
I just wanna have a little fun while I'm still alive
I don't wanna sit around getting older
I just wanna piece of your good time, good time tonight


how come nothing's ever easy? (ooh ooh ooh)
you know I never asked for roses in my garden
but it's starting to feel like
the gods got something on me

no one wants another jesus
hanging over the good times

and they're ready and willing to use it (ooh ooh ooh)
to keep me from being too happy
to keep me where I'm supposed to be

and it's got me
right where I'm s'post to be

oh why can't it just be easy?  (ooh ooh ooh)
why can't it just be easy?  (ooh ooh ooh)
why can't it just be ...


how come life can't just be easy?
no one put roses in my garden
but I'm starting to feel that
the rug was pulled from under me

the gods got one on me
and they're willing|ready to use it
to keep me in line

I could move the mountains but it won't mean much
if I have a dream and no one else shows up

but that could BE us
riding off TO the sun
kicking up DUST
leaving it ALL behind
baby that could BE us
building a LIFE on love
making storyBOOKS come True
one PAGE at a time

---
making all our own luck

I could chase the moon down but it don't mean much


I know all the reasons you don't believe in love, cos I felt them too
but anything is possible if more than one person wants it
and we were built to love, so we know it's possible
we've seen everyone around us have their moment, why not us
these are just invisible walls between us, we made them in our own minds
they were based on real things, but they aren't real
maybe just once we could see what happens if we arrange things how we want
and if not then it couldn't hurt

and I gave it all I got
and I tried to keep the faith
threw my caution into the wind
and it hit me in the face
and you've come to the end
of the endless race it's just
time to start over again

been to the choir but I couldn't sing
been to the cross but I couldn't hang
talked to the angels but they said nothing
been to the temple but I couldn't pray
been to the house but I couldn't stay

been to the mountain but I couldn't climb / all the way to other side
been to the club but I couldn't join
talked to the shrink but he said I'm fine

been to the dance but I couldn't sweat
went back home but there was no one there
been to the forum but I was lost in the crowd
been in the sauna but I couldn't breathe
been where I am and been where you wanted
been to the river but it wouldn't roll

drove down the road til I ran out of gas
been on me knees but I had no prayers
been to the rally but I couldn't stand / all this talk of the promised land
knee deep in quicksand

down in the valley up on the hill

been to the back rooms

seen the plans they were overrated

been to the east been to the west
been to the right and been to the left
middle of nowhere was all I could find
stuck on my own running out of time, cos...
[stuck on my own, run out of time]

been in the shadows, walked in the sun
waiting for a day that'll never come, cos...

but I'll never...
make it to the promised land
see the end of it
make it to the other side
find the exit out
find the holy grail

turning me inside out
turning me upside down
I'm falling backwards
and I've been falling down

you brought me to pieces and you taught me to breathe

slippin' backwards and I'm falling away
I'm falling backwards and you're slipping away

I'm slippin' backwards and you're falling away

I'm falling down and you've been falling away

you're moving on and I'm learning to breathe

never was an easy road

you were here and you were gone
while I was learning breathe

giving you the reins


now that time has come and I'm still learning to breathe


now I'm running in circles and you're running away

it ain't easy when the cards don't fall your way

far cry from

one day closer to the grave

so far away

wash away

king for a day


farther every day

I've been waiting on the right time

I hear love's been going around
just say the word and we'll be the talk of the town

whispers don't make a sound

I wanna be the one singing love songs with you
I want the day to come

strong in us
strong enough

we've been wrong enough
for long enough
if we're not strong enough
to call it off

a whole lotta nothin (is whatcha getting from him)
a whole lotta pain (is whatcha paying for it)
just come here and get a whole lotta me
a whole lotta time (is watcha staying for)
a whole lotta life (so watcha waiting for)
just walk out that door and get you free
you gotta whole lotta me

do whatcha gotta do
if ya wanna do it too
I gotta say to you
the way that I know how to do

take your body
move it slowly to me
let's get it started
we got world's there to see

it could be the glory of your dreams
it could be the story of your life
it could be much more than it seems
so baby don't ya fade on me tonight

hey now when it comes down to it
I love the love but I can't take the shit
you're giving to me
hey now when it comes down to it
I love the love but I can't take this shit
from anybody




I'm tired of waiting on this love train
it's pulling out of the station
everyone is making time
but it's leaving me behind

ooking at your style
everything except your smile
fades into the scenery
we all see what we want to see
it all looks good to me
and I'm dreaming of the day
you look at me that way
and we walk hand in hand
where the sun meets the shine
blind leading the blind
like it was meant to be

didn't mind going blind
til the darkness caught up with me
you were heaven sent hell bent
on making a mess of me

did I go too far
did I break your heart
don't mean to say the things I say
sometimes it just comes out that way

that's more than enough
to get me through this life
that's more than enough
to keep me satisfied
that's more than enough
[to turn the lovelight on | get me going strong]
that's more than enough
to keep me holding on

You may say
You’re ok
With today
but

I want I want tomorrow
All that I’m asking
I want I want tomorrow
A love everlasting

I wish I could die
for your suffering
cos it kills me too

they're killing me
with their blank stares
they're killing me
with a drop of water [blood]
they're killing me
alone with the darkness
they're killing me
waiting for some love

holding back the love

with their atom bombs
they're killing me
with their hammers
they're killing me
with their mockery

===

one foot at home
one foot in the unknown
two eyes towards the sky
unbeautiful unblind

the fire and the rose

now I can see past my own eyes
now I can see past my own lies
now I can see that all this time
I've been standing here
unbeautiful unblind
all this time
unbeautiful unblind

line; find; shine; mine; behind; mind; fine; trying; crying; untie

she, alone, wanting, reaching out
me, undone, holding on to scattered hopes
just one more thing to hold on to
there, before the altar of the past
gone, the best things never seem to last
maybe they'll come back like lost birds do
ooh ooh how could I tell her?
ooh ooh why would I try?
ooh ooh how could I tell her... goodbye
life in a donut hole
is never too far from the light
coffee two creams room to breathe
hail mary & hallelujah
it’s gonna be alright


---

Life in a donut hole
Walk down to the corner store
Coffee two creams whiskey neat; sugar sweet
Say a prayer for the god of ya never know; Hail Mary & hallelujah & hows the weather cos ya never know, how it’ll go on... can ya hear me now
What’s on the other side of the hole



I bet ya think your anger is important
'Cause your world revolves around you
But you’re just a stranger to me
And you’ve done nothing to make me care
And you wouldn’t care either
So by all means have a nice day
I hope we can be friends some day
When you think it’s cool to behave like a normal human being
But I’m not interested in demonstrating to you how hip and with it and engaged and woke I am just to validate your meaningless existence if you can’t find your own meaning then don’t expect it from me

yada yada yada
say whatcha wanna
but keep your hands off me
cos you can keep on yappin

beggars can't be thieves

I ain't trying to change the world
I'm just trying to get through to the one girl
who'll listen to me
and I aint trying to chase the moon
I'm just trying to get through to you
while you're still drunk than me

taking the world as it comes
taking the last train out
making it last in love


... I'm broken in pieces

working up a [hot] love
got me in a cold sweat
working on a case of you
cos you going to my head

here comes another one
just like the other one
here comes another one
it's gonna end up the same way

I'm gonna think on it (just a little bit)

you can hang your hat on the first hook you see

hold on just a minute
I'm ready if you're willing
it's time to get on with it now

lucky for me
I'm in with the queen

and that's a long way to come
with only half a prayer
cos my love is well-done
she's still medium rare

and it's like trying to be a monk with only half a prayer

and I'm a son of a gun
back where I came from

and I'm a love struck [lorn; sick] monk with only half a prayer
you can't make [feed; save] a monk [nun] with only half a prayer

I'm gonna sit in my room
I gotta ticket to my doom
I had it coming, all this time
it was in me, made it mine

and every day I'm a little more free
I feel the fire inside of me
I can't love back when I'm on my knees
she came and went, now she's all I see

oh oh, see this picture fade to black
oh oh, fade it in again



---

badda bing, badda boom
blah blah blah, shadda zoom
doobee doobee, a la zone

ah gadda shay enty mine ah eem
ah shalla frim fraily shadda team
she aisle can see go lah dah dee
poo lah insate, fa sha day me

oh, ship it you fool to the sock in the clown
oh, ship it you fool

everyone is slipping into comfortable these days
gonna find the devil hiding in so many places
everyone is sliding down the trap staircase
gonna hit the bottom before we find our way

I've been burning the candle of our love
down to my finger tips now the smoke is clearing up
I can finally see you blinding bright
make it darker for me, cos you're naked in this light

and I'll leave you here with a heart of shattered glass
you'd never even see the shadow I could cast
I've been burning the candle of our love
down to my finger tips now the smoke is clearing up

the memories are bitter but bring me back to you
I'm always wondering if I should have asked for more
the memories are bitter, they're left inside of me
I always wondered if

I should have asked for more
I was only trying to breathe
you made it to the door
but you left me on me knees


throw it on the wall but it just won't stick
try it on for size but the shoe don't fit
I got a bone pick

you're taking me over
I'm shaking all over for you (ooh ooh)


my heart beats out of time
my temperature is rising
you're taking me over
I'm shaking all over

tingle in my skin
and I'm seeing stars again
cos you're taking me over
I'm shaking all over for you

if you wanna walk
do just what you want
if we drift apart
if you can't dance with who brought

then you fell out of the love tree (uh huh)
landed right on me (ooh woo)
now I'm so happy (uh huh)
that I'm with you (you you you fell out...)

you fell out of the love tree (uh huh)
...
now I'm so happy (uh huh)
that you are mine

here is the house that I built for you
what difference does [do] it make?
weigh me down
ride it
surrender to the air
personal affair
that's enough | enough of that
letting go
satisfaction [hunger & satisfaction]
spirit world
back to where we were
where it's at
thinking on it
I know her
how soon (we forget)
born for it
here in a city
I know it's there

I've been working on the low-down
I've been wating in the wings
but I ain't never gonna slow down
until the fat lady sings

I've been holding up my horses
just waiting for the time
but I'll be right here at your doorstep
until I make you mine

gonna make ya mine (uh huh)
gonna make ya mine (oh yeah)
gonna make ya mine



---

I've been livin on the low-down
I've been riding on the breeze
I've been trying not to slow down
catches up to me

I've been hiding out in midtown

she's stuck on automatic
I tried to reach her
til I forgot about it
the way I need her still
but she only wants what she can't have (oh yeah)

I saw it comin' from a
thousand miles in fronna
you took the wheel and you were
driving backwards and I
knew it was time to let this go

she's coming back
for the rest of my heart
she's coming back
for what's left of my soul
she's coming back
just to tear me apart
she's coming back back back
to the watering hole

you're looking at me with those puppy dog eyes
and I can't hide how I feel
when you're looking at me with those puppy dog eyes
I wanna know that this is real

I wanna move with you
when you move with me
I'll always feel that way
when you look at me

it's just a little bitta country love
she got me with those puppy dog eyes
I think I'm gonna get me one
little piece of heaven tonight

(didn't know I was in love with you)
til I started singing your praises
talking to the neighbors

(didn't know I was in love with her)
til I started singing her praises
talking to the neighbors
sending up prayers
can anybody help me
find a way to her

dancing in the rain
trying to find a way to her heart
picking you daisies
finding new ways to
say things about ya
signing your wavers
players; ray-bans; jaybird; haters; caters; pleasures
getting home later
taking elevators
tipping all the waiters

don't look at me like that
cos if I can't have you
don't wanna turn the love light on

don't look at me like that
cos if I can't be yours
I just wanna be gone gone gone

if you're headed up to the sky
won't you save a ray of light for me [won't you fly on a ray of light for me]
so I can see

and if you're head's stuck in the clouds
won't you pull a piece of heaven down for me

so pour me a drink
pour my troubles down the drain
then turn up the radio
make the world go away
and we can talk about the old times
before they've even passed
we're here today
too bad for yesterday
I can't take it back

please won't you tell me
it's gonna be alright
I ain't looking for an answer
just a little peace of mind
and please won't you tell me
it's gonna be okay
I ain't looking for a promise
I'm just waiting for a sign

---



please won't you tell me
it's gonna be alright
I ain't looking for an answer
I'm just looking for a sign
and please won't you tell me
it's gonna be okay
I ain't asking for a promise
just some peace of mind

it's how we do it in SF
cold chimay by the sunset
load the prius with

...
tech
new app
hoodie
jet set


gonna shout it to the mountains (alright)
gonna send it to the stars (alright)
gonna put it on a fast train (alright)
gonna watch it til it's gone (alright)
...
gonna be the one who tells ya

I'm just waiting on the
dam to break I know your
petty grievances
are coming round my way

I have no power in me
they'll hold it all against me
these petty grievances
are gonna get me some day

some day some day some day
these petty grievances
are gonna get me some day

I said hey ya (hey ya)
I said hey yo (hey yo)
I'm under the radar
I'm comin' on the down low
I said baby (baby)
I'm taking the long road
...

---
I'm sneaking in the back door

I'm opening the window; crawling through the peephole

I'm waiting for the say so
ain't gonna be no sideshow

I ain't puttin' on no show
I'm under the radar
...


well it's time to feel it
well it's high time now



well it's tit for tat
gonna tip my hat
til I get it back
there's a word for that
it's called gettin in the act
when it gets in you
and you're hooked on the groove





getting in the act
getting back on track
taking the night back / before it takes you
knowin where it's at / when it's time to move
steppin up to bat / when they call on you
puttin in the past / when the day is new
livin in the past / but the day is new / when you're...
makin the night last / before the feeling's through


in every heart is a silence that's waiting
ten years to come and you're never alone
just for a moment in a world full of strangers
you find the broken hearts put back together as one

and it comes
like a flash of rain
and it goes
like chance on the wind
and I know
you only gave it everything
I'd just be waiting
for that stranger again

I'm running out of time
but I'm still alive

---

in every heart is a silence that's waiting
we stood apart on an island each praying
I saw a heart just trying to say it
we were a dot, a lie in our own ways



december morning in the falling snow again
woke up still dreaming and I got to go again
so I'll pack my things and head out for another coast


all these worlds [lives; dreams; all this life] I've been passing through
I'm just making my way back home to you

[I'm just taking the long way back home to you]

---
time was dreaming
and the summer came and went
world was spinning
on the shining dime it spent
far away from here
in the shadows of the past

took the last train
outta sanity
hoped and prayed
we could find eternity
til it came around again
another world that could have been

but one road gone is another's found
one soul lost is one more crashing to the ground

all this time I've been passing through
I'm just making my way back home to you

I want more (oh oh oh)
I want to be the star shining for your star
I want more (oh oh oh)
I want to drive off your cliff in a flaming car

making my way back to you
I walked through the fire
building a home in your heart
building a castle of desire

turn me up
take me on
rock me out
like a radio song
take me home
turn me on
won't be long
til I'm all yours

turn me up
turn me on
rock me out
like a radio song

take me home
won't be long [take me on]
...
and I'll be yours


cut me loose
won't be long
til I'm free
and I'm long gone

Learn to breathe
Sky is purple
Learn to sink
Wanna be pop but I’m not

and if you be my marilyn monroe
i'll be your joe dimaggio
if you believe the dream is never lost
they sold us a bridge
but it can still be crossed

cos if you be my homecoming queen
I'll be the second coming of james dean
and if you believe that there's still a place for us
past the tv, the tabloids, the radio talk

then be my marilyn monroe
so I can be your joe dimaggio

I know how it goes
you got fire in your shoes [bones]
you got boil in your blood
you got steam coming from your hood
I know how it ends up
ice cracking in your veins
writhing in your chains
another chance at fame

one shot of glory
shooting through my body
this is how they got me
living life this way

one shot at redemption
one world to put a dent in
then say you never meant it
to be this way

it's nothing to them
no sweat on their skin
no pot to throw it all in
no chance at more

they can just sit back and watch
I know they will
they've got nothing better to do
then be the fair weather fans with you at the end

I got this
I don't care
where it ends up
I got this
rolling down the track
hand in fist
in glove in arms
I got this
before they can turn it back

girl cos no one else can save me now
you brought me down
now raise me up
you took me in
now let me out [turn me out]

tell me lord what I do this for
can I have the will to walk away
cos every step I take that isn't out the door
is one step closer to my grave


I'm gonna suffer without your love
it's an offer I can't refuse
but I'm ready to take nothing
if that's only thing you're giving me

I'm gonna get out while I still got time
I've got some living left in this life of mine
and I'm ready to get nothing
cos it's more than I got left in me

[chorus]
tell me lord what I do this for
give me the will to walk away
cos it's one step closer to the door
or one step closer to the grave

===
But I ain't lie like a zombie in your arms
wasting it all away
one step away from the door
two steps closer to my grave

what the hell am I doing lord

===

What the hell am I doing here
in your arms
like a zombie
sleeping my way
into the grave
one foot for another
I'll go ahead and suffer
there's no love out there
but I don't want yours

But I ain't gonna walk like a zombie to my grave
