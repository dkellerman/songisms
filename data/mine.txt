storm is coming you're down on your luck
catching rain in a paper cup
until the sun shines harder
just enough to start a fire
then pack your bags and make like a tree
four door car with a tank of dreams
just push the pedal down lower
til you're cutting round those corners
and if they tell you now
to take the scenic route
don't let em slow you down
this train is glory bound
ain't nothin wrong with ya
wanting more if ya
wanna be a star
you can be anyone
don't let em try to
take down your high 'cause you
ain't stealing light from the sky
if you make your own sun
when you arrive and you're living that life
just keep these times in the back of your mind
'cause it all starts over
but you're never out of fires
and if you catch em trying
to cut you down to size
they're never gonna like
your castle in the sky
and they can't make you drive at 65
so they can paint their lines
where the sun don't shine
so if they point to signs
to keep it 55
well they can paint their lines
your dreams will not be denied
your fire can not be contained
your love is deep as it is wide
it won't fit between these lanes
so if they tell ya
to keep it all inside
so if they tell ya now
to kick the devil out
down-hearted queen on your way up
down in the dumps on your way up
queen of the underground's headed up
you can make the sun shine harder
you'll make the sun shine harder
trains are all gone and the horses
just press the pedal down harder
it won't make it any slower
and when you arrive don't remember these times
you'll be alive when you live in the light
don't let em say that you're crossing the line
they'll try take the credit
but you're the one who said that
well you can't walk that line
to the other side
like a train in the night
like a flame in the wind
here for the rest of my life
on that stranger to come round again
uh oh when she gets that feeling
oh no now i got to go
and i'm sure there's all kinds of reasons
but i don't want to know oh oh oh oh
i don't want to know oh oh oh oh
bum bahm chakka chikki
it won't last for long
'cause one minute love is here
the next one she is gone
i want more (i want more)
i wanna be the one who lights your star
i'm gonna drive off your cliff in a flaming car
don't look at me that way
don't make me want what i can't have
our worlds are not the same
you live it better on the other half
and if you save it for a rainy day
when it comes you gotta run the other way
you shouldn't be seen with freaks like me
just think what your friends will say
you're gonna throw your reputation down the drain
(woh oh oh oh oh) down the drain
you saw me coming
a thousand miles away
i've got a message to the world
i'm fed up with the tears
i'm sick of all the games
i'm tired of playing dumb
while the good life sits right here
wrapped up in a bow
tied up in a knot
someone to open the door
someone to boldly go
where no one's been before
falling down from cloud nine
cutting through the line
gonna find my way to you
oh oh back to you
it's been too long
waiting out the storm
oh oh i lost my mind
give it all i got
tell me whatcha want
i can make it real
gimme just a shot (uh oh)
at your big time, big time, big time, big time
big time (uh oh oh)
left me in pieces
like a tidal wave
worth all the heartache
it was the only way
i could have learned
it's a long way to the top
you're gonna get there, or you know you're not
'cause it's a short walk to your bed
if you wanna lay down, better lay down dead
'cause it's better late than never, if never never comes
you never were a quitter twiddling your thumbs
got a golden ticket, you're not the only one
'cause no one really cares where you came from
a little bit of this, a little bit of that
a little bit of cattle, a little bit of hat
takes a whole lotta love
takes a whole lot, whole lotta love
darkness comes in fast
looking for the light, it's been looking for you back
'cause the story's gotta end your way
a cowboy needs a sunset like the dessert needs rain
one step to another, one step out the door
one day i swear it's gonna be behind me
working up the nerve to walk into the real world
putting on these pants one leg at a time
you had yours, now i'll go get mine
one way or another i'm gonna make it alright
gonna find a ladder up to cloud nine
you were just a bump on the road to freedom
you were just a tick in the clock of time
now you're gone, and i am fine
and i ain't got the heart to miss ya
now that you are through with me
and i ain't got the time for this 'cause
my love ain't for your charity
and if you're looking for a happy ending
i can't make guarantees
but if you want to get back in my heart
then you're barking up the wrong tree
take me or leave me or leave me alone
gonna get my train back onto the track
say what ya wanna or nothing at all
it was good, 'til it was bad
hey won't you send me a sign
i'm waiting on you one day at a time
throw me a line
send me a sign
we ain't never gonna live this down
you might have thought i was born yesterday
'cause i couldn't read your signs
but hello, pleased to meet you, and goodbye
tall dark handsome and rich
and i would have waltzed right off into the night
never knowing what i missed
'cause i've been on this road all my life
i've felt the fire and i've seen the light
i've been the fish and i've been the hook
seen pretty covers and real good books
but i never felt the way i feel tonight
i've got a feeling it all comes down to this
and i want to remember the look in your eye
as we stand here floating over time
bending these moments to my will
or just a poor player acting out his part
try to stick it out until the bell
and i took wrong turn without an end in sight
'til the only way left to go was right
but i've been around once or twice
the kinda love from just one look
a pretty cover and a real good book
but i've been down this road once or twice
and when i feel the fire, i see the light
i know the love from just one look
you could pretend i was born with a brave heart
bending this moment to my will
but i'm just a poor player acting out the part
trying to stick it out until the bell
one in a million stroke of luck
now i've been looking at a life for two
and i found a room with a view
i found the genie in the lamp
a pot of gold on a rainbow ramp
'cause i never felt the way i feel 'bout you
you might have thought that i was born yesterday
but hello, pleased to meetcha, and goodbye
and i know a fire from the light
i know the love from the look
pretty cover on a real good book
and i want to remember the look in your eyes
as we stood here floating over time
bending the moments to my will
so if the poetry ain't rolling off my tongue
maybe it's not for everyone
see my poems all were made to be sung
by a choir of the lovestruck and the drunk
and i've been picking up a thing or two
and i know a room from the view
i know a genie from the lamp
pot of gold on a rainbow ramp
but i never felt the way i feel with you
i've got a feeling it all comes down
we got we got we got got today
now i want tomorrow
i just wanna get out of your doghouse tonight
make two wrongs into a right
this here's a message from the bottle to the ship
the sea is endless but you're not sailing it
just seeing things the way you want em to be
looking for a needle in a haystack
going down a one way track
never thought i'd say that
find a way back
you had a message
you had a message for me
and you'd been trying to get through
well you may have thought i was gone
but i've been waiting for you
but now i'm here for you
but now i take it back
well i may have said i was dead
excuse me baby did you hear what i said
i can't stop these little voices in my head
you gotta move over
i'm a force of nature
and i'm blowing with the wind again
ya get what ya give
so this time i'm never gonna doubt it
it is what it is
all i know is i can't live without it
if i closed my eyes
i could have died
to live this again and again
put away my broken heart
i don't need it anymore
i can't get too much of you
all the little things you do
every little way you move
all the things you do to me
every way you make me feel
if you got a bone to pick
if you got an itch to scratch
if you got a little bit
of your love to give
i'm gonna give it back
'cause i've been thinking bout ya girl
i've been getting lost in you
trying to keep my cool
but that only proves
i can't get enough of you
every little thing you do
i've been spinning round in circles
trying to get back to the place we were before
back when the whole world was new
and every day was only hope
that you and i could fly away together
into skies of blue
but now those skies are falling down, and i'm
holding on to the arms of a stranger
waiting for the candle to burn out
'cause even you're a stranger to me now
you were the one i thought that i knew
you were the candle with the flame burning down
to my hands 'til i let it go
and let it fall to the ground
holding out for the arms of a stranger
holding on to what's left of my soul
'cause everyone's a stranger to me now
everyone i turned to turned away
every storybook was not for me
you were the dream i could have in this world
you were the one song i could sing
every light i held was a candle's flame
burning down 'til my hands let it go
you were the one that would never go out
now you're gone, and i'm
holding on to what's left of my truth
'cause everyone's a stranger now but you
everything i knew turned the other way
everyone i held was a ghost
every lie i waited to come true
now i'm just a body waiting for a soul
you gotta come out from the shadows
stuck in your head
it's time to move on to the real life
come out from under your bed
'cause the sun is rising in my world
and the light's shining through
i got all my ducks lined up girl
they're just waiting here on you
the haters, the traitors, the tinkers and the tailors
take a message, get back to em later (and just)
tell me what ya want
show me how ya feel
and i can make it real for you
ya gotta get into the right swing
put on your dancing shoes
time to step up to the real thing
get lost in the groove
the beggars, the players, the smooth operators
(real for ya) i'll make it real for ya
and if you wanna start a fire
you gotta burn it down
and if you wanna make it fly
show me watcha feel
you gotta swing for the fences
it's your turn at bat
go and do what you're meant to
put on your dreamer's hat
'cause they never gave you nothin
but they took everything you gave em
so go on and take it back
been a minute in the fog
waiting on things to come
wasn't it gonna get a little better?
been a life waiting for
you to knock on my door
hurry up, put down those love letters
take a message get back to em later, just
give me a little piece of your sunshine
been a slog through the mud
rolling round with lady luck
trying to make her go a little faster
throwing fits in the dark
hope they saved us one more ever after
take a message get back to em later
the the players, the fakers, the smooth operators
well i don't need another mountain to climb
but i still got the will
if we can find a way
i still got this feeling
everything's gonna be ok, if ya
always one step behind
come save me from these ghosts
i'm down in the valley losing my mind
gimme some of your good sunshine
i'm down in the valley losing my mind again
i fanned your fire
i walked through flames
all to play a losing game
i tried to change
it was all the same without ya
i let it take me (i gave it all)
to hell and back on a round trip plane
only came out knowing one more answer
turned out i'm better off without ya
i'm better off without ya
better off on my own
turns out i'm better off without ya
i'm getting there on my own
i jumped through flames
it just ain't the same without ya
it's all the same without ya
i could fall in love with your face
with those eyes that you make
when you're smiling at me
i could fall in love with the way
that you glow when you say
what you say but you can't see
that i'm turning to jelly inside
and i'm always on the edge of my seat
and i wish you would send me a sign
so i'm not falling endlessly
in love with a run-away dream
but i'm trying to keep
my cool but it seems out of place
when every time that you smile
i fall in love with your face
i can't follow you into the deep
but if you go
at least would you leave me a rope
'cause every day my boat
drifts a little farther from the shore
i can't promise you i will keep
my head up high
so at least would you leave with your knife
'cause every day it's cutting me
a little deeper to the bone
there was a time i thought i would die
without you by my side
but life has a way of making you face
the things you want to hide
so i'm coming to my senses now
calling all the big dogs out
forget the roses oh baby i know this
the truth was right under my nose
that i'm better off without you (uh huh)
i'm better off alone
i'm better off without you (uh huh)
just a little bit better on my own
i'm better off without you
there was a time i thought i'd find
under a rock or just by dumb luck
and hoping for the best
but i'm coming to my senses now
why pray to angels and shake magic eight balls
i can do the happy dance with two left feet
gonna hit the fast lane
gonna jump the next train
gonna take a walk to easy street
i won't bring roses 'cause baby i know this
sick of the hopeless 'cause baby i know this
we set our sails for diamonds in the blue sky
rising on the other shore
to be the happy after ever after
writing our own storybooks
but it was only sparkles on the water
shining there just out of our reach
and we were always jumping on the big waves
swimming through an endless sea
love in a time of
love in a time of love
take the doubts now down in to the river
and let it wash your sins away
we've got to dream the only dream that matters
the one they told us of some day
but it was only words thrown to the wind now
and we were only ships inside a bottle
waiting to be free one day
but it was only words thrown to the wall now
no one ever had their say
another log burning on your fire
another lover singing in your choir
it was good enough for me and you
it was one more night that we made it through
i had my fill and you had your fun
two more bullets from a loaded gun
but i don't care bout the price to pay
your party will go on when i'm gone away
and everybody's got an axe to grind
but this ain't mine
tell me bout it someday baby
tell me all the things that i didn't know
when i don't care bout you no more
you keep your boys out on the run
tied up tied down under the gun
those hard times come and go
and just make you better for it
so don't put away your broken heart
don't put away your broken heart ooh ooh
don't put away your broken heart
'cause there's lovin' left to do
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
so many islands out on the sea
so many waves between you and me
we can't go on this way
so many thens keep us from now
so many walls we could have knocked down
we can't go one more day
so let's go up to the top of the world
and fall like two drops of rain
and take these moments one by one
'cause it's never gonna be the same
never gonna be the same
feeling as this one
feeling as this love
and let's go up and fly to the sun
and burn in each others arms
and take these moments as they come
'cause there's never gonna be a feeling like this one
it's never gonna be the same way for us
i'll meet you where the trains don't go (oh oh)
out in our own little world away from it all
say goodbye to your friends
we'll be back again
when love's the only thing we know
that's where the trains don't go oh oh
where the trains don't go
she's walking out of the skyline
wind blowing back her hair
she's meeting me on an outbound train
but she can take me anywhere
take out your pen
i'll strum some chords
let's make a rhyme
tell me you're mine
i'll tell you i'm yours
that didn't take so long
sing me a kiss
i'll sing back two
'cause these harmonies are so sweet
and if you're feeling it too
let's make a love song
those stories never come true
but don't put away your broken heart
'cause there's real love to do
living through the end of times
building a castle in crazy town
waiting for the good life to show up
like an angel crashing down
and loving on a one way dead end street
has only got me turned around
driving it backwards every day
'til i'm back at the end of the road
i'm just waiting for the nick of time
holding out for a little luck
is that lightning gonna strike
or is my time already up?
i didn't get the message
there could be something better
i was sitting around waiting for some day
i waiting around for you to come my way
til you're back where you started from
holding out for a stroke of luck
living in the strangest kinda times
will get you half-way to crazy town
waiting for the good life
is kinda like waiting for the end of the world
and love is a one way dead end street
it'll get ya just a little turned around
until you come to the end of road
is the good life there to find
can i find the good good life
is there love out there to find
jumping off the end of the line
the end of the end of the line
'cause lord knows when it all goes down
i was a ghost on a train passing through
trying to find a home in this world
but yesterday went so fast (yesterday)
yesterday went so fast (yesterday)
i was okay keeping up with today
now i wanna make something to last
i was just wandering into the dark
trying to hold my candle up high
is that the way
that our story ends
half way to something
we'll never have again
that a love falls down
in front of you without making a sound
it's too late for us now
yesterday went so fast
i'll find a way now to live for today
'cause i couldn't make yesterday last
i'd raise a glass to the lost loves
if they'd remember me
and we'd drink a toast for the foolish old ghost
of the man that i used to be
and i'd raise a glass to the old friends
but now they've all gone away
they all found their home in this world
and left me here to say (that)
now i'll say a prayer for the good life
someday may it find me
here at this bar with an empty glass
humming an old melody
i know they say that it never goes away
but i couldn't make yesterday last
i couldn't make yesterday last
you might win the battle
but you're gonna lose the war
with one hand on the trigger
and a hand in the cookie jar
you won't get far with that attitude
we could learn to like
real life as an afterthought
though blue suburban skies
were painted on our hearts
and maybe we could be
even happier than we were told
and at very least
we can say it was our own
born between the lines
in the pages of a storybook
believing we could fly
before we ever learned to walk
i'm just trying to get off the ground
looking up 'cause it's a long way down
let the sky cry all our tears
trying to dodge the rain
born into a crazy time
safe inside our mind's four walls
half the world's just getting by
but we always wanted more
but they stole that plan
right out of our hands
so we're taking it back
yeah we're taking it back
we're taking it back
to the world that's right front of us
where we could always look
but we could never touch
and they built that life for us
now we're taking it back
and i know that i've been living with some ghosts
but it's time to let them go
and we can keep the life they stole
'cause we're taking it back
we could call it our own
born into a grave
safe inside our own four walls
i've been cryin to the sky
there's no sunshine today
the tears that fall like rain
and my hands start shaking, my heart starts racing
and i'm praying we can figure this out
'cause i can't stand living with a clock that's ticking
when the only time is now
no one needs our innocence
at least we'll say we took the long way down
and they made our plans, so we're making them back
one road came and another went
followed it in circles til i was spent
until i finally found the place that i had left
right back where i started from
now i'm just waiting for the end to come
all the roads lead to one
and rode off to the setting sun
lost in the weeds since the day i was born
blazing a lonesome trail through the world
followed the road down to the end
running in circles til i was spent
someone wake me up when the end is come
kicking up dust since the day i was born
this world is wearing me down
waiting on a line for the line
that's how it feels
when you're chasing your tail
til the end of time
well ashes for ashes and dust for your dust
a million times more won't add up to much
right back where you started from
someone wake us up when the end has come
strapped to a rolling stone
when you're spinnin your wheels
must, lust, such, much
prayer for the gods and a slap in the face
when i was hoping that the end had come
one road straight the other bent
following the path other had lead
and i looked around
and i rolled into town in a '97 jetta
doors were shaking and my foot stuck to the pedal
i've been trying to make my way to mrs make-it-alright
looks like another two-bit saturday night (alright)
it's just another two-bit saturday night
hey buddy i could drown in my beer
if i weren't here talking to you
saw a sight from the corner of my eye
but she disappeared too soon
of a man always out of key
but she isn't looking for me
rolled into town in a '97 jetta
i'm just trying to make my way to mrs make-it-right
looks like another two-bit saturday night
just another two-bit saturday night
so babe would you give me two more chances
to prove my love to you
'cause i tried to make a deal with the devil
but the devil didn't come through
roll into the city in a 97 jetta
flying through the red lights holding down the pedal
just trying to find me a mrs make-it-alright
looks like it's gonna be
looking everywhere for mrs make-it-alright
things are looking up but they ain't getting better
found the words but nothing comes out right
we drank em under the table
and fell asleep on the floor
we were ready willing and able
but they showed us the door
'cause there ain't nothing else to do around here
but sling back your whiskey and hope for the best
i said it's not over til it's over
she said we've already crossed that line
i can't tell one feeling from another
so i'll jump on into the ocean
and i'll kiss the shore one more time
and ride this wave to the other side
ride this wave to the other side
see all the ways we could have lived that life
and you never paid them any mind
for the rest of our lives
we'd better use this all up right here and now
before we say goodbye
gotta find a way out of this town
been sinking so fast i'm already underground
one foot in the mud
the other's running away
got a mind to throw it all away
can't leave the stable without burning some hay hay hay
gonna set a fire
one place or another now
i ain't a lucky one
seventh son of a seventh son
gotta take whatever comes my way
so i ain't waiting (nah nah)
for the clouds to break apart
i ain't waiting (nah nah)
for a light to shine through the dark
the train leaves today
can't let it get away
i ain't waiting for a better day
for the red sea to part
for the orchestra to start
got plans for today
ain't wasting my time praying
picked my soul up at the lost and found
i'm tired of looking for things i can't see anyway
been up and down these streets
my heart cupped in my hands
from the left coast to the right coast
looking for the promised land
sometimes it's a long way down
and there's no easy way around it
time to saddle up the horse
and get back on it, make that jump
'cause the only way over is up
and get back on it
sometimes the only way out is up
gotta mind to throw it all away
one way or another
gonna pave the road with tears
we been longing so long
there's nothing left to long for
i got plans for the rain
i won't waste them away
i'm six feet underground
so i wear my fire like a tattoo
'cause i've been burned so many times
there's nothing to go back to
but i wear this desire like tattoo
left home so long ago
and it's time to take the devil down
time to take the devil down
six more feet under the ground
it's taking me over
i'm shaking all over
i'm ready to take the devil down
rage in my veins
can't sit still, run away
looking round the room
crazy eyes, poker face
and i feel it heating up, working up a sweat
boiling over, cutting through
here again, on a razor's edge
ticking clock, shaking bomb
sending us to kingdom come
going off, as we run
time is now, on the mark
they don't have a piece of mind to give
they're gonna give it anyway
they don't have a better life to live
they're gonna live it anyway
they don't want it if it's gonna be hard
they're gonna try to take it from me
they're gonna try to make me do it
running fingers through my hair
sweat on my forehead
pacing the floor, back and forth
words come stammering out
flinching, razor's edge, on edge
heating up, boiling over, running hot
steam rising, blood boiling
don't want to be like this, get a grip
running for the exits
looking for the exit (sign)
papers scattered on the floor
stupid people are trying to hold me back
but i can't stop now
'cause i put so much into this
i've got no life to go back to
but it's not their turn
so i'm gonna take the devil down
it's out of control can't make it stop
i'm gonna take the devil down
it's my chance to do something for the world
so i'm gonna take the devil down!
and i refuse to be a fool for a fool
that somehow we're both gonna lose
yeah we know we're both gonna lose
drowned in my tears too many times now
swallowed your pride too many times now
'cause i'd rather be a fool for a fool
than to live my life without you
i got a boat
out here on the diamond sea
just trying to stay afloat
looking for good company
and while i've been praying
that the end's in sight
all my friends been saying
hey man it's gonna be alright
i got a note
that's searching for a melody
i keep a little hope
it's gonna find somebody
to find a pod for their pea
that same palm tree
cast aways out on the sea
you and me are headed for the same palm tree
underneath that same palm tree
we're all headed for the same palm tree
i got a lock
waiting for a golden key
i'm selling all my stock
and packing up the company
alone and alive i said
i learned to like the sleepless nights
i waited up for you
but no angels came upon me
no visions in the night
i prayed until my hands caught fire
i cursed the candle light
and i cried all i'm listening for
is a love song drifting from an open door
save me a place in your heart
make me a joyful sound
lay me down in your arms
and i will call it hallowed ground
alone and alive we said
we learned to like the sleepless nights
we learned to live the homeless life
we learned to start over again
and make the same things new
and i'll keep on listening for
a love song drifting from an open door
make a place to belong
play me a joyful sound
make me a place in your heart
give me a world where i belong
take me where i belong
tear all your fences down
wake me into a new world
and i'll call it hallowed ground
wake me into your arms
show me an end to this road
paint me a sky of blue
give me a place to call home
make me a home in your arms
living through the dark days
riding on a bad wave
this bomb is ready to blow
and they're lining up my ride to the other side
but i ain't ready to go
i got a feeling
the sun is coming back again
this day is never gonna end
we're gonna be alright
we're gonna live in the light
and i'm trying every way
to make it through the day
with my feet on the ground
and the time has finally come
but i can't see the sun
with my head in the clouds
and when the new day is finally in sight
i'm gonna stand high, throw my
two hands up into the sky
with my head up in the clouds
and my feet stuck in the ground
sometimes i can't seem to move
and i tried the spiritual and the miracle cure
but that only works on the sincere and the pure
one foot on the track
and one foot on the ground
they're tired of running away
head's up in the clouds
but i'll be coming down
soon as i find my way
'cause i got one hand on the trigger
and two feet in the
i got my head in the clouds
and i ain't coming down
til i shed off this frown
gonna throw my hands to the sky
and i'm trying to ignore
the fire outside my door
'cause i ain't ready to go
'cause it's one foot in the real world
one foot sinking deeper
into a mountain of
i'm stuck inside a bad dream
'cause it's one foot in the fire
the other in the pan
'cause i got a few more things left in
my bucket list of dreams and
it's kinda hard to let go
to do before i'm all set (before i lose it)
and it's too hard to ignore
and i'm trying to ignore it
'cause the real world's at my door but
i ain't ready to go
tried to stop the war
'cause they're knocking on my door
and i tried to fall in line
and i tried to tune it out
and i told 'em all to stop it
and i tried to make it stop
but real life is knocking
but ain't ready to go
'cause i'm already all in
when i hear that trumpet calling
i'm coming down from the hills
you you you make me feel everything more
you you you let me be everything that i want
you make me feel everything more
you make me feel everything
when i got clouds to chase away
when i got endless days of rain
you're there when i need ya
and when i'm too high up in the sky
when i got lightning in my eyes
i know that you feel it
'cause sometimes it takes a lot
to put away your broken heart
and take a little step out your front door
but sometimes it takes a lot
to take a broken heart
and throw it out into the wind
to open up your heart
to see all that the world has got to give
and you make make me feel everything more
you make make me feel everything more
you make make me feel everything everything more
you make make me feel everything
you lift the clouds, you clear the fog
you make me see things with my heart
you make me feel the beat of my heart
you make me see the light shine through the fog
you paint the colors on a cloudy sky
breathe, beat, see, feel
when the sun is shining i'm burning up (mm hm)
and when i'm down i'm under the ground
then i hit rock bottom and bounce
you make me feel uh huh everything more
you make me feel uh huh everything everything more
gonna hop a rocket and fly away (hey hey)
'cause when i'm high i'm good as it comes
and when i'm low there's nowhere but up
i don't need those pixie dust dreams
i found my muse in a human being
i got the hots and i'm sweating bullets
been chasing memories around
let em loose and run em down
been seeing ghosts of you
i got an empty room with a better view
i kept my head afloat
found the raft, sank the boat
and finally i'm fading out of blue
i kept the bigger half
sank the boat, kept the raft
and everybody's telling me
the best things in life are free
if you're headed for a strike-out
on a saturday night out
looking for your real friends
to drown out that feeling
call it a night, wait for the light
and c'mon down to the old bar
little coffee and jack
we'll be knockin' 'em back
with the sunday morning all-stars
he fell on rain
and found a way to her heart
she sailed on waves
through oceans and winters
and nothing could keep them apart
their names on the breeze
and painted their leaves
and they came down
with the change of the season
right back at the start
so he fell on rain
i bought a rose for someone
and i thought about the times we spent
before she got married
as i put it in a vase
it's been so long
holding on to hope in vain
waiting for this long forgotten love
adding up the yesterdays
for us i know
back in the valley again
wondering how low i can get
of strip malls and heartaches
to end up where i began
right here back in the valley again
but it's too late for holding
on to these old dreams
i'm stuck in the valley again
and wondering if this road
is ever gonna end
it's too late for me now
to make my own way out
driving down highways of
strip malls and heartaches
and wondering where this road ends
and when the next life begins
you don't need say goodbye
if you wanna go
i ain't putting up a fight
i don't even need to know
and you don't gotta to waste your time
talking to an empty room
you just gotta realize
that baby i'm as gone as you
love me or leave
or make me believe
we're going somewhere fast
'cause i won't give you my whole life
if you won't give it back
how can you have one more chance
if you didn't want the first
if we can't make this work, then baby
i'm already out the door
and you don't need to waste your time
do it when the time is right
you don't need to waste your time
'cause baby when you say goodbye
i'll be gone as you
'cause if it's done then it's done
stick a fork in it
i don't need a novel
just for calling it quits
you don't need to say goodbye
to an empty room
baby i'll be gone as you
left the great out there behind
ten years was a long goodbye
made myself a beeline for the old town
just another world that i
lost myself trying to find
something i thought i'd find by now
but everything real comes back somehow
so much for up and on
i'm coming back to that good old place
right where i started from
i found a home where i can lay
this old hat down
i'm putting it back on solid ground
everywhere i look i find
same story different time
everybody trying to fill the void
but now i'm headed back to see
same town different me
i don't need a miracle just yet
'cause everything that's real never left
in how many worlds must i
lose myself so i can find
i don't know when i got to go
throw me back out into the world
it don't matter baby
and i don't know if you feed me lines
i don't care if i'm wasting time
all i know is i know what i need's
right in front of me
you're my sugar pill
you're my candy lovin'
you're my two of these
and babe i'll call you in the morning
maybe it was an angel
that flew on down that day
gave your hand to me
took my heart away
'cause how'd you know it was just in time
or how many nights i prayed
to make this all worthwhile
to live to see a better day
now i won't give up when the time's get tough
i only want you to stay
love won't keep us together
love won't tear us apart
love is not here forever
love is only a start
let it rain let it rain
fill the empty space
let it pour let it pour
wash away my sad face
and a lifetime of the pain that came before
from the water bring new birth
wash away this scorched earth
and a million sad refrains we sang before
where loneliness and harmony collide
meet me there and help me fill the void
wash away these lost years
i don't know what happened to you
you got burned by the fire you walked into
and i watched from the comfort of my misery
i always thought that my pain would set me free
and i don't know what became of us
we always knew that this road was dangerous
but we kept walking til we wore out our feet
and ended up somewhere we didn't want to be
now you can chase love out to hell and back
you and me, we're just pieces of the broken dream
i don't know if the thrill is over yet
i've been waiting for the day that i'll forget
putting that life six feet underground
it's high time that i burned my bridges down
things are so different here now that you're gone
i've been flirting with the thought of moving on
step by step down the road of time
i've been waiting for a dime
i always thought that fate would rescue me
i always wondered what hell had in store
i didn't know what got into you
you were so hard to see
couldn't make it go away
the shining hope of my world again
appears out of a foggy mirror
just one more day
trying to catch up
with the last one who got away
so today i'm gonna jump into a brand new ocean
and try to find a better way
until the moon falls out of the sky
and lands right at my feet
i'm gonna keep on chasing these beautiful lies
because it makes my life complete
we were living in an afterthought
and we were chasing empty ghosts
now we're the downcast on our way up
we might as well have settled for half full
now real life is an afterthought
and they of perpetual rewind
handed us the keys
to the kingdom of the blind
catching rain in a paper cup (oh oh oh)
we never thought to settle for half full
so we're going digital
we're making love bit by bit (going digital)
we built our whole world on it (going digital)
they sold the dream then broke our hearts (going digital)
two hearts in perpetual motion
we were handed down the keys
to a kingdom of the blind
they gave us the keys
unlocked a door to nowhere
and wild and free
and ours got lost
in the endless sea
but we swam back
for one more try
to make one night
last all our lives
now we've been shakin the ceiling
while the neighbors are sleeping
tryin move heaven and earth
tonight we'll dive off the deep end
tryin to find that old feeling
giving love its moneys worth
and gone too soon
and we're just ghosts
on our way through
trying find a moment
and find the spirit
that we can move
is a funny thing
it can make the angels sing
love is lost but when it's found
it can make the world go round
living in each other's light
we can make it last forever tonight
she's got the motor on
got the radio blasting my song
but this moment won't last long
here one day the next one she'll be gone
she's got the sails up high
got the stars set in her sights
and the sky's so clear tonight
she can see straight through to another life
'cause she's too cool for me
someday i'll see her on the cover of a magazine
i'm just another boy who needs a girl
and she is only passing through my little world
she's got the devil by her side
and the angels holding on for dear life
and if you take her up on the ride
don't expect to make it out alive
she's got the world at her beck and call
they're lining up straight out the door
and if i try to break up this fall
i'm only gonna fall a little more
she'll make you roll the dice
and if the numbers come out right
she got the magic carpet ride
but if you play the cards just right
you could steal a little piece of heaven tonight
she's got the world on a string
she's got the wind at her back
she's got the training jumping off the track
cut you some slack
she's got the knick and she's got the knack
she's got everything i need
she's got the will and she's got the means
she walks the talk and does the deeds
she got the wind at her back
she got the sails up high
down to the last drop
don't stand a chance
sky is clear tonight
but the sky's so clear tonight, you can see
sitting by my side
want her by my side
highway's shining in her headlights
who'll wear your boots when you are gone
who'll yodelay your cowgirl song
who'll roll in the hay
and let you ride the horse all day
tell me who'll wear your boots when you are gone
who'll fill the pantry when you leave
who'll stir the pot and cook the beans
who'll wind up your clock
and put the key into your lock
tell me who'll fill the pantry when you leave
you're always 1, 2, 3 steps from the door
you're always gettin' in then you're gettin' out
then you're gettin' back for more
but tell me who'll wear your boots
who'll wear your boots
when you are gone
who'll fill your pantry when i'm gone
who'll cook the beans and pop the corn
ten years making my way out of a paper bag
to find the world's just same as i left it
now the bad's still bad but the good ain't better
you can change yourself
but that don't change the weather
i was the one wondering why anyone would
stay in bed sleeping in forever
so i ran down the dream
but that didn't change the weather
sun shinin' through where they said it'd get better
'cause you can dodge the rain drops
funny feelings sneaking up inside of me
calling out through my stomach walls
and never even know
but it's heads-down hands-up hail-mary
can you break my lonely fall
'cause i threw the rockwell out the window
a long long time ago
a long long long long time ago
and now the ribbons are falling out of the sky
and cupid's angels are packing it up
but even that wouldn't be enough
i've been taken over by a strange fascination
like i'm 8-years old again
and there's nowhere to turn but my own imagination
'cause i've fallen in love with a lesbian
she got her voodoo spell hanging over me
magnets pointed at my heart
she got the angel's smile and the devil's eye
marching me to the beat of her second-line
making circles round her heart
forever circling around her heart
'cause i'm lovestruck again
and i never wanted it to be this way
but i gotta take it where i can
knocking on my stomach door
calling me through my stomach walls
and she'll never even know
but there's nothing i can do or say now
to break my lonely fall
when self control jumped out the window
and it don't matter if i laugh shout or cry
it's never gonna be enough
i've been taken over by this strange fascination
like i'm 8 years old again
but there's nothing there 'cept your own imagination
you've got to keep your control
got some funny feelings sneaking up inside me
calling through my stomach walls
and my house of cards is tumbling down
'cause i've lost my self control
she's got a way of standing on the chimney
as your house burns down
and when she smiles at me basking in the glory
i only want her more
she's got the stars in her eyes
and i want to hold her tonight
worse than anything i've ever felt
and she might think it's a joke
but i want to hold her like a kitten
and treat her the like queen bee
sometimes i want to hold her
and have her spend the night
and sometimes when the feeling takes over
i'm afraid that i will try
makes me question things i thought i knew
and anywhere this crazy life goes
i want her here with me
to hold her like a kitten
love her like a sister
and treat her like a queen bee
makes me see the possibility of who i could be
something i never dreamed
don't know what to do with myself with my love
strange love, bubbling up
the ribbons are falling right out of the sky
and cupid's angels are packing it in
'cause no love no pain will make you whole again
when you've fallen in love with a lesbian
now they're taking down the ribbons down from the sky
all the tunnels have shut off their light
taking over my daydreams
watching my house of cards fall
to save a broken heart
'cause it's a one way dead end road
but the world didn't stop turning for my pride
it's not a crying feeling
this breaking of my heart
'cause part of me knew how it'd end
right from the start
and i went blind but now i see
that our grace became our fall
and that's not a crying feeling
just a wake up call
we liked to say the beaten path wasn't for us
and together we made our way through the wilderness
but we always had our star
our little light shining afar
and we always had the comfort of each other's arms
and today all the stars have gone away
we used to make our way together through the wilderness
just two happy soldiers of the light of love
johnny blue jeans is living undercover
handed his dreams to the working week
got a masters degree in something or another
and living on paper is harder than it seems
but that road leads to nowhere in the end
everything good is still out there waiting
you're spending all your karma on fair-weather friends
and finding that there's no one left to repay it
'cause now they're on you like a hound
but when you need em they won't be around
so if you're gonna get outta town
gotta burn some bridges down
like you'll never be back
burn some bridges down
you're on a one-way track
there's no reason to get comfortable
'cause it's time to set fire to your little world
benny the jet is a good friend of mine
seems like forever but nobody's counting
and ran away to a life in the country
but that'll only get you so far away
everything you have is right here waiting
you're gonna have to come back to the city someday
they'll catch you lying flat on the pavement
and what did it get you anyhow?
everything bad comes back around
so take a tip if you wanna get outta town
time to burn some bridges down
i know i've been getting kind of shy
sitting on these words of mine
trying to work in a line
i know they're knockin at your door
and the games they play can be such a bore
and everything you get is more
than you bargained for
so whatever gets ya in the groove
whatever makes ya wanna move
whatever gets ya feeling high high high high high
is what i wanna do to you
that's what i wanna do to you
you held the hoops and i jumped through the fire
now i look stupid and you look inspired
how did i wind up singing for your personal choir?
you climbed the mountains while i ran the rat race
somehow my face wound up on a banana peel
so next time here's the deal
i ain't doing your rain dance
uh no oh, ay ay ay
ain't doing your rain dance
uh no oh, ay ay i ain't doing that dance
no i ain't doing that dance
i took the beads
i took staten island
and you're taking queens
staring at the tv, 24 hours of nothing much
emptiness inside me been reaching out to feel your touch
and the days and weeks have passed
so fast since we've been apart
now i want you to be here again
bringing up the morning in my arms
i know i said it first
and i meant it, every word
but this feeling came from the blue
and i know we said goodbye
and i've had my chance to cry
but i need you
next to me tonight
breathing in and out and in
anything to calm my mind
cruel world's been closing in
i can't be alone for the rest of time
maybe i just want to know you're lonely without me
it's such a selfish kind of love
and i know i left you first
but i need you in my arms tonight
it's such a selfish kind of love that we need
and i know how much it hurt
you can't put my ship in a bottle
i'm sitting on the highest cloud
lettin' my feet hang down babe and
watching the world go by
'cause you been hanging up all my moons
i'm just looking up at the view babe
and counting the stars in my eyes
giving it all i got
giving it my best shot babe
ya hit me in the sweetest spot
loving ya with all my heart
i knew right from the start babe
sitting on the highest cloud
loving you with all i got
living in a teenage dream
feeling it in my bones babe
taking it day by day
letting it all play out babe
and tryin not to fall apart
letting the chips fall down
feeling it to my bones babe
i got no worries left for you
now tomorrow's coming through
but i got no worries anymore
ain't got one beat for you beating in my heart
it's too late to care what you do
i'm over getting over
i'm in no hurry
to care about you 'cause i got no worries
the shadows of love
love of a brother
you wear it well
or so i've heard
tears in the tide
a candle and a flame
right where i began
we've come so far
it happened one day
too bad for nothing
life at the end of the tunnel
take it or leave it
you make it ok
back at the wind
i've given up on the ghost of you
running round in circles
drowned in these blues
gonna make it my own
right in this moment
breathe in the truth
i've been a prisoner of your love
holding on to something i can't have
my feet were stuck in the mud
been all the way to hell and back
let's find our side of paradise
let's make a world of our own
let's get out beyond these city lights
somewhere the trains don't go
find our side of paradise
so we can get to the good part
your eyes say all i need to hear
your static's ringing in my ears
million nights on the road
missing our life waiting for your call
babe i'm coming home quick
i'm home sick for
the way that you kiss me
the way you move
a bottle of wine
and a sip of you
baby tell me how long can we kiss goodbye
if you gonna break my heart don't do it twice
nothing we can do tonight is gonna save this love
we can keep on trying but the nick of time
ain't gonna come for us
the seas and all that stirs within them
my conscience stabbed with pain
up to my ankles in it
headed in the right direction
one glass of beer one glass of wine
if we go up in smoke
if we go down in flames
baby just hold me close
and remember my name
you're the quiet one
you're the wild one
you're the party one
you're the guarded one
you're the one who gives
you're the one who takes
you're the one i dream of when i lay awake
and i like them all
taking, laid back one, make it, getter done
birds of a feather
cream in your coffee
birds and the bees
so you found a smooth talker
with a silver tongue
you can take him back
to meet mom and dad
just a prince charming
with a fighting streak
then he brings you flowers
and gets down on his knees
and all your friends just roll their eyes
you'd go better with me
a little bit of loving's a whole lotta nothing
a little bit of heartbreak knocking at your door
a little bit of you's a ticket to the blues
'cause i'm gonna need a whole lot more
some things you thought would be around forever
you wake up one morning and they're gone
some people change your life and never say good bye
but their memory will always carry on
we've got nothing but heaven tonight
i'm getting high as i wanna tonight
we're starting fires in a world of ice
i'm gonna hit the highway
you shoulda come with a warning sign
i thought i told ya for the millionth time
we came a long way into the light
i wasn't born with a broken heart
we might as well get higher than life
if you're thinking like that then baby you thunk right
gotta a whole lotta nothin tonight
let me out of your doghouse tonight
we're making some kind of magic tonight
all i want is that feeling again
got a long way to go tonight
i'm gonna feel this for the rest of my life
counting time to the beat of my heart
don't look at me
give me that look
come and get it
better late than sorry
settle for the night
you should have known
one line to draw
i got it easy
jump on a train
take it out to the end of the line
leave the world we know
beyond this sea of lights
there's gotta be something else
out on the other side
take it out to the edge of the world
in those hills of grass
where we can search for gold
i've been keeping my foot down on the gas
headed somewhere else and nowhere fast
hitching a ride out on the wind
to hell and back and back again
saddle up and go
live for the fight
take the show on the road
take the show back home
part of the plan
heart of the problem
one shot of love (and two shots of heartache)
one shot of love heartbreak back
givin' it my best shot
cool to be cool and hot be hot
hit the ground runnin' in the nick of time
back on the case
back on the town
down with the cause
if the one don't get ya the other one will
how does it all go down
hard case of love
suddenly i can breathe a little easier
gonna paint by numbers 'til i make you mine
she's a double whammy
can i have a moment with you?
fool for a fool
queen of the underground
here tomorrow gone today
when it all comes together
ace in the hole
can you feel me
i've spent too long in the darkness now
i've been looking for someone a lot like you
i just want a fat chance
gettin' on the case
cuttin' to the chase
i'm going down with it
gonna drown in it
take me back to the wishing well
jack and diet coke
get it while it's good
heart of gold with a silver lining
take it down a notch
fast talking, slow walking, two-timing man
you can do better than that
no one showed up for the end of the world
turning me inside out
i thunk (it, you sunk it)
where do i sign
barking up the wrong tree
if your heart ain't in it
too late for the nick of time
time's been ticking away
when it comes down to it
here comes another one just like the other one
let me get that straight
let me out of your doghouse
we can make a long story short
here's a message from the bottle to the ship
wrote a message on the bathroom wall to myself
for a good time call someone else
i'd do it all again
i'd live another life
i'd make the same mistakes
if i could feel that way one more time
this time there'll be no apologies from me
i got my life
it ain't the high life
she didn't come with a warning
if it's 50 50 or it's 90 10
we came a long way through the valley
born with a broken heart
all i'm asking of you
and all i'm asking of you
is you love me a little bit too
get me up with the sun
put a little coffee in my cup
wake me up to your love
wake me up uh huh
never gonna fall in love
never gonna get enough of your kisses
never gonna get enough of this
to fall in love
i'm asking for the millionth time
i'm losing my mind
i told you for the millionth time
when that feeling comes back to you
i'll be waiting right here for you
when that feeling's taking over
i'll be taking out the phone to call ya
hey hey babe i know that it's la-ate
i had the feeling you would answer
'cause i just can't wait
another lifetime for your loving
another lonely lonely life
a lot like you
you got whiskey with your eggs
and you're praying at the bar
well baby you can play
for the sunday morning all stars
oh baby go on make me yours
oh sugar cover me with your love
oh baby i've been waiting for this day to come
i've been waiting for some
cover me with your kisses
oh baby i've been patiently waiting for you
gimme just a fat chance
'cause it's slim pickin's
i got big plans
but it's heavy lifting
need a little bitta help here
i'm on the shelf dear
you gotta throw me a line
but the clock's a-tickin'
when the stars fall down from the sky
when the world has come to an end
when my words aren't enough
you can take my love
and start over and over again
it's poetry in motion
and emotion in the pure
i still speak to you in dreams
always part of me
fade a little every time i breathe
you are the truth
that made me real
i'll be the shoulder you lean on
i'll be your soldier i'll be your song
the seed of doubt
the grief (and expression of) - blues
the saving of a dark heart
the three loud noises
queen of the underworld
lost queen, wandering the earth
long way down down down
one minute here, the next one it's gone
i ain't got the blues, i just ain't got you
back to the dream
frannie lou, queen of hearts
the last of the blues
it's a long way down down down
to the bottom of it
while the loving's good
take it with you
show me the door
this can't go on
we can't go on like this
something in your heart
end of the road
take me for a fool
wicked woman, hella man
fast talking, slow walking, two timing man
giving it back, loving me back
was a penny and
you're just a fast talking, slow walking, two timing man
can't stay, can't go
can't play, can't fold
i'm gonna drown in it
just waiting 'round for the end to come
got nothing now but a two-bit love
living in a silent scream
running backwards through your dreams
you gotta give everything you take
goodbye to new york city
hello to the skies of blue
whatever this long road has waiting for you
if you're going somewhere i'm going there too
it's time to let it go (pain, love, the past)
i want more than i'll ever have
one day we'll make it
i still haven't found what i'm looking for
i want you so that i can be myself
why didn't i see what i had
let's drive off together
let's get away from this place
it's time to let that bird fly
it's time to let it all go
we got the world on a string
we got one day at a time
how can i a find a way back
why can't i find a way back
those days will never come back
i still got stars in my eyes
i'll never get where i'm going
i've seen the love in your eyes
one day we'll make it alright
i'm still trying to find
we got nothing but time
i got a lifetime to go
i know you're taking it slow
it's all a blur to me now
it's all a dream to me now
i hear the rhythm of love
show me the truth in your eyes (lies)
sounds good to me
let's call it a plan
just you and me
when it comes down to us
ashes to ashes, love to love
your heart ain't in it
baby i'm an outbound soul
'cause ya know that there's no one else
that can keep me hangin round here
and baby i'm an outbound soul
that can bring a good man down
like the way you do
so i'm headed out
baby i'm just fog town bound
and ya know there ain't nowhere else
that can keep the sunshine out
when i need a little blue
and baby i'm just fog town bound
'cause ya know there ain't no one else
so i'm headed down
headed down to fog town
'cause ya know there ain't no one round
here to bring a good man down
girl so i'm fog town bound
time will, move in, circles
time will wear us down
time will, crash in, to the shore
long after we are gone
but someday, when you throw my ashes to the sea
someday, when i'm riding on the wind
i'll live forever in this memory
i'll be back here with you again
someday i'll ride that wind
back here to be with you again
waiting for that moment
how come nothing's ever easy
i know i never asked for roses in my garden
but it's starting to feel like
the gods got something on me
we were washing our cats
we were waiting to a-
pply more makeup 'cause the
those jeans made us look fat
we were waiting for the
we had bills to pay
one day she was so sweet and kind
next day she had changed her mind
and here i am dazed and confused
never knew i had so much to lose
from the ashes to the rising
from the flames that turned to ice
from one end to the other she had me hooked
to the grave and from the cradle
with her angels and her devils
happy days are somewhere inside this life
i'm gonna find my way to the bottom of it
we don't wait for clouds to break
we don't ask the sun to shine
we already got it
you and me, we're keepin it cool
at the movies at the mall
crank the ac in the car
jump in the river like two foo-oo-ools
'cause you and me, ooh ooh
we're keepin it cool ooh ooh
just keepin it cool ooh ooh
we're just keepin it cool
and we'll be back for more
to soak up the sun
we're keepin it cool
mama you can get high
you can get low
you can go anywhere you wanna go
baby stick with me
it's just a matter of the birds and the bees
come together, no delaying
we gotta dance while the music's still playing (loud)
wanna hold you in my arms right now
we ain't got nothing on the birds and the bees
he fell on rain, found a way to her heart
he traveled oceans, swam through puddles in the dark
and it was all a world they'd never seen
fits and starts and storyboards
skies set on suns, moons rose from trees
he fell to earth, one day from the blue
take a picture of my face
put in a frame
put it on your nightstand
let the time fly by
from now until forever
then turn on the light
and move on to the next life
and let me stay here in your memories
let me stay here in a moonlit scene
let me stay here resting in your arms
i will be here long after you're gone
so close running scared
fly it down, let it go, cut it loose,
let it come back to you
so still empty air
breathe it in, let it go, take it back
it will be here again
what if we never close the circle
what if we never make the sun shine
like it did that day?
we still can't tell if it was a dream
if it was real, but who cares
it doesn't matter anymore
so far horizons fade
let it rise, take the light, let it fall
it will always be there
i don't wanna talk it over
i don't wanna sit around getting older
how come nothing's ever easy? (ooh ooh ooh)
you know i never asked for roses in my garden
no one wants another jesus
hanging over the good times
to keep me from being too happy
to keep me where i'm supposed to be
and it's got me
right where i'm s'posta be
oh why can't it just be easy? (ooh ooh ooh)
why can't it just be easy? (ooh ooh ooh)
why can't it just be
how come life can't just be easy?
no one put roses in my garden
but i'm starting to feel that
the rug was pulled from under me
the gods got one on me
to keep me in line
i could move the mountains but it won't mean much
but that could be us
riding off to the sun
leaving it all behind
baby that could be us
building a life on love
making storybooks come true
one page at a time
making all our own luck
they were based on real things, but they aren't real
and if not then it couldn't hurt
and i gave it all i got
and i tried to keep the faith
threw my caution into the wind
and it hit me in the face
and you've come to the end
of the endless race it's just
time to start over again
been to the choir but i couldn't sing
been to the cross but i couldn't hang
talked to the angels but they said nothing
been to the temple but i couldn't pray
been to the house but i couldn't stay
been to the mountain but i couldn't climb
all the way to other side
been to the club but i couldn't join
talked to the shrink but he said i'm fine
been to the dance but i couldn't sweat
went back home but there was no one there
been in the sauna but i couldn't breathe
been where i am and been where you wanted
been to the river but it wouldn't roll
drove down the road til i ran out of gas
been on me knees but i had no prayers
been to the rally but i couldn't stand
all this talk of the promised land
knee deep in quicksand
down in the valley up on the hill
been to the back rooms
seen the plans they were overrated
been to the east been to the west
been to the right and been to the left
middle of nowhere was all i could find
stuck on my own running out of time, 'cause
been in the shadows, walked in the sun
waiting for a day that'll never come, 'cause
make it to the promised land
see the end of it
make it to the other side
find the exit out
find the holy grail
turning me upside down
and i've been falling down
slippin' backwards and i'm falling away
i'm falling backwards and you're slipping away
i'm slippin' backwards and you're falling away
i'm falling down and you've been falling away
you're moving on and i'm learning to breathe
never was an easy road
you were here and you were gone
while i was learning breathe
giving you the reins
now i'm running in circles and you're running away
it ain't easy when the cards don't fall your way
one day closer to the grave
king for a day
i've been waiting on the right time
howl on the dirty moon
what do i have to do
who do i have to know
i can't be somebody i can't be
just to get through to you
get back on the horse
back in the saddle
fake it til you make it
on your case (on the case)
i'm not made of
monkey in a barrel
down to the bone
(stuck) between a rock
got places to be
see a man about a dog
you're a bad bad man
ain't looking to get comfortable
makes the baby jesus cry
the other side of the bell curve
kiss me you fool
foot in your mouth
slippin' in, slidin' up
out the door (back door)
jumped out the fire escape
put it in your pocket
rain on your parade

down to the ashes
cut off your nose

better safe than sorry
i hear love's been going around
whispers don't make a sound
i wanna be the one singing love songs with you
i want the day to come
we've been wrong enough
if we're not strong enough
to call it off

just walk out that door and get you free
you gotta whole lotta me

if ya wanna do it too
i gotta say to you
the way that i know how to do
move it slowly to me
let's get it started
we got world's there to see
it could be the glory of your dreams
it could be the story of your life
it could be much more than it seems
so baby don't ya fade on me tonight
hey now when it comes down to it
i love the love but i can't take the shit
you're giving to me
i love the love but i can't take this shit
i'm tired of waiting on this love train
it's pulling out of the station
everyone is making time
but it's leaving me behind
looking at your style
everything except your smile
fades into the scenery
we all see what we want to see
it all looks good to me
and i'm dreaming of the day
you look at me that way
and we walk hand in hand
where the sun meets the shine
blind leading the blind
like it was meant to be
didn't mind going blind
til the darkness caught up with me
you were heaven sent hell bent
on making a mess of me
did i go too far
did i break your heart
don't mean to say the things i say
sometimes it just comes out that way
that's more than enough
to get me through this life
to keep me satisfied
to keep me holding on
i want i want tomorrow
all that i'm asking
i wish i could die
'cause it kills me too
with their blank stares
with a drop of water
alone with the darkness
waiting for some love
holding back the love
with their atom bombs
one foot at home
one foot in the unknown
two eyes towards the sky
the fire and the rose
now i can see past my own eyes
now i can see past my own lies
now i can see that all this time
i've been standing here
she, alone, wanting, reaching out
me, undone, holding on to scattered hopes
just one more thing to hold on to
there, before the altar of the past
gone, the best things never seem to last
maybe they'll come back like lost birds do
ooh ooh how could i tell her?
ooh ooh why would i try?
ooh ooh how could i tell her goodbye
life in a donut hole
is never too far from the light
coffee two creams room to breathe
hail mary & hallelujah
it's gonna be alright
walk down to the corner store
what's on the other side of the hole
i bet ya think your anger is important
'cause your world revolves around you
but you're just a stranger to me
and you've done nothing to make me care
and you wouldn't care either
so by all means have a nice day
i hope we can be friends some day
but keep your hands off me
'cause you can keep on yappin
beggars can't be thieves
i got things to do
i got reasons to live
i got things to live for
all this shit bout me
but say whatcha wanna
i wanna hear ya
say it to my face
scoobee doo (bee doo)
tell me what you want what you really really want
i ain't trying to change the world
i'm just trying to get through to the one girl
who'll listen to me
and i aint trying to chase the moon
i'm just trying to get through to you
while you're still drunk than me
taking the world as it comes
taking the last train out
making it last in love
i'm broken in pieces
working up a love
got me in a cold sweat
working on a case of you
'cause you going to my head
here comes another one
just like the other one
it's gonna end up the same way
i'm gonna think on it (just a little bit)
think on it (just a little bit)
think on it (just a little bit more)
et me get this straight
straight as ya gonna be
clear as i'm gonna see
if i come to be senses
swing for the fences
still just a little late
yeah, let me get this straight
straight from source of pain
straight to hell in a handbasket
before i even said it to you
and find a way
to make it alright
better off without you
give me the good life
i'll get what she got
life on planet nine
i just got it
what i gotta do (to get through to you)
if you're headed down
if you're headed up
i ain't got the words (for that)
i ain't got the time (for that)
slice o' the pie
got me in her good graces
i'll figure it out
when it gets ya
when it comes around
when love comes around
the best in ya
the best from ya
down to bare bones
driving with the pedal down
last mile of love
hold on just a minute
i'm ready if you're willing
it's time to get on with it now
i'm in with the queen
and that's a long way to come
with only half a prayer
'cause my love is well-done
she's still medium rare
and i'm a son of a gun
back where i came from
you can't make a monk with only half a prayer
i'm gonna sit in my room
i gotta ticket to my doom
i had it coming, all this time
it was in me, made it mine
and every day i'm a little more free
i feel the fire inside of me
i can't love back when i'm on my knees
she came and went, now she's all i see
oh oh, see this picture fade to black
oh oh, fade it in again
badda bing, badda boom
blah blah blah
oh, ship it you fool
everyone is slipping into comfortable these days
gonna find the devil hiding in so many places
everyone is sliding down the trap staircase
gonna hit the bottom before we find our way
i've been burning the candle of our love
i can finally see you blinding bright
you'd never even see the shadow i could cast
the memories are bitter but bring me back to you
i'm always wondering if i should have asked for more
the memories are bitter, they're left inside of me
i always wondered if
i should have asked for more
i was only trying to breathe
you made it to the door
but you left me on me knees
throw it on the wall but it just won't stick
try it on for size but the shoe don't fit
i got a bone pick
you're taking me over
i'm shaking all over for you (ooh ooh)
my heart beats out of time
my temperature is rising
tingle in my skin
and i'm seeing stars again
'cause you're taking me over
i'm shaking all over for you
if you wanna walk
do just what you want
if we drift apart
if you can't dance with who brought
then you fell out of the love tree (uh huh)
landed right on me (ooh woo)
now i'm so happy (uh huh)
that i'm with you (you you you fell out)
you fell out of the love tree (uh huh)
that you are mine
here is the house that i built for you
what difference does it make?
surrender to the air
back to where we were
how soon (we forget)
here in a city
i know it's there
i've been working on the low-down
i've been waiting in the wings
but i ain't never gonna slow down
until the fat lady sings
i've been holding up my horses
just waiting for the time
but i'll be right here at your doorstep
until i make you mine
gonna make ya mine (uh huh)
gonna make ya mine (oh yeah)
gonna make ya mine
i've been livin' on the low-down
i've been riding on the breeze
i've been trying not to slow down
catches up to me
i've been hiding out in midtown
she's stuck on automatic
i tried to reach her
til i forgot about it
the way i need her still
but she only wants what she can't have (oh yeah)
i saw it comin' from a
thousand miles in front of
you took the wheel and you were
driving backwards and i
knew it was time to let this go
for the rest of my heart
for what's left of my soul
just to tear me apart
she's coming back back back
to the watering hole
you're looking at me with those puppy dog eyes
and i can't hide how i feel
when you're looking at me with those puppy dog eyes
i wanna know that this is real
i wanna move with you
when you move with me
i'll always feel that way
when you look at me
it's just a little bitta country love
she got me with those puppy dog eyes
i think i'm gonna get me one
little piece of heaven tonight
didn't know i was in love with you
til i started singing your praises
talking to the neighbors
didn't know i was in love with her
til i started singing her praises
can anybody help me
find a way to her
dancing in the rain
trying to find a way to her heart
finding new ways to
say things about ya
tipping all the waiters
don't look at me like that
'cause if i can't have you
don't wanna turn the love light on
'cause if i can't be yours
i just wanna be gone gone gone
if you're headed up to the sky
won't you save a ray of light for me
so i can see
and if you're head's stuck in the clouds
won't you pull a piece of heaven down for me
so pour me a drink
pour my troubles down the drain
then turn up the radio
make the world go away
and we can talk about the old times
before they've even passed
too bad for yesterday
i can't take it back
please won't you tell me
i ain't looking for an answer
just a little peace of mind
and please won't you tell me
it's gonna be okay
i ain't looking for a promise
i'm just waiting for a sign
i'm just looking for a sign
i ain't asking for a promise
just some peace of mind
it's how we do it in sf
cold chimay by the sunset
load the prius with
gonna shout it to the mountains (alright)
gonna send it to the stars (alright)
gonna put it on a fast train (alright)
gonna watch it til it's gone (alright)
gonna be the one who tells ya
i'm just waiting on the
dam to break i know your
are coming round my way
i have no power in me
they'll hold it all against me
are gonna get me some day
some day some day some day
i said hey ya (hey ya)
i said hey yo (hey yo)
i'm under the radar
i'm comin' on the down low
i said baby (baby)
i'm taking the long road
i'm sneaking in the back door
i'm waiting for the say so
ain't gonna be no sideshow
i ain't puttin' on no show
well it's time to feel it
well it's high time now
well it's tit for tat
gonna tip my hat
til i get it back
there's a word for that
it's called gettin in the act
when it gets in you
and you're hooked on the groove
getting in the act
getting back on track
taking the night back
before it takes you
knowin where it's at
when it's time to move
steppin up to bat
when they call on you
puttin in the past
when the day is new
livin in the past
but the day is new
makin the night last
before the feeling's through
in every heart is a silence that's waiting
ten years to come and you're never alone
just for a moment in a world full of strangers
you find the broken hearts put back together as one
like a flash of rain
like chance on the wind
you only gave it everything
i'd just be waiting
for that stranger again
i'm running out of time
but i'm still alive
we stood apart on an island each praying
i saw a heart just trying to say it
we were a dot, a lie in our own ways
december morning in the falling snow again
woke up still dreaming and i got to go again
all these worlds i've been passing through
i'm just making my way back home to you
and the summer came and went
on the shining dime it spent
far away from here
in the shadows of the past
took the last train
we could find eternity
til it came around again
another world that could have been
but one road gone is another's found
one soul lost is one more crashing to the ground
all this time i've been passing through
i want more (oh oh oh)
i want to be the star shining for your star
making my way back to you
i walked through the fire
building a home in your heart
building a castle of desire
like a radio song
til i'm all yours
and i'll be yours
and i'm long gone
wanna be pop but i'm not
and if you be my marilyn monroe
i'll be your joe dimaggio
if you believe the dream is never lost
they sold us a bridge
but it can still be crossed
'cause if you be my homecoming queen
i'll be the second coming of james dean
past the tv, the tabloids, the radio talk
then be my marilyn monroe
so i can be your joe dimaggio
i know how it goes
you got fire in your shoes
you got boil in your blood
you got steam coming from your hood
i know how it ends up
ice cracking in your veins
writhing in your chains
another chance at fame
one shot of glory
shooting through my body
this is how they got me
living life this way
one shot at redemption
one world to put a dent in
then say you never meant it
to be this way
it's nothing to them
no sweat on their skin
no pot to throw it all in
no chance at more
they can just sit back and watch
i know they will
they've got nothing better to do
where it ends up
rolling down the track
in glove in arms
before they can turn it back
girl 'cause no one else can save me now
you brought me down
now raise me up
you took me in
now let me out
tell me lord what i do this for
can i have the will to walk away
'cause every step i take that isn't out the door
is one step closer to my grave
i'm gonna suffer without your love
it's an offer i can't refuse
but i'm ready to take nothing
if that's only thing you're giving me
i'm gonna get out while i still got time
i've got some living left in this life of mine
and i'm ready to get nothing
'cause it's more than i got left in me
give me the will to walk away
'cause it's one step closer to the door
or one step closer to the grave
but i ain't lie like a zombie in your arms
wasting it all away
one step away from the door
two steps closer to my grave
what the hell am i doing lord
what the hell am i doing here
one foot for another
i'll go ahead and suffer
there's no love out there
but i don't want yours
